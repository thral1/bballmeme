Well it looks like the man with the Shemp Howard hair-style is going

to be the new leader of the Stooges. But this time it is not the Three Stooges its the Twelve Stooges as it appears that Kurt Rambis is going to be named the new coach of the Minnesota Timberwolves. The “St. Paul Pioneer Press” is reporting that Rambis is expected to be officially named head coach in a press conference that could be held this Tuesday.
Rambis is going to be going through some major Frickin culture shock
with the Timberwolves. He leaves the NBA Champions for one of the worst
Frickin teams in the NBA. But it is a head coach position and his first
so it was not like Rambis was dealing from a position of strength if
you get New York Vinnie’s drift. However Rambis My Man you are going to
a team that has very few Frickin assets and a whole bunch of Frickin
liabilities.
Minnesota Team Owner Glen Taylor told reporters he is excited to get
Rambis on board. He said “Kurt, with his experience playing and
coaching for a winning organization and working under people like Pat
Riley, will bring a lot to our organization. In meeting with him and
talking to him, I know he’s very excited about having an opportunity to
help build his own team.”
Okay Rambis My Man this Taylor is not the most Frickin trust worthy
guy in Pro Sports. Earlier this year Taylor said that if Kevin McHale
wanted to come back as head coach the job was his. Well that did
not turn out to be the Frickin case as new Team President David Kahn
fired McHale. So go into this position My Man knowing that the man you
are working for is basically a lying Pud.
The Timberwolves won just 24 games this past season. With the way
the roster currently looks they will not win that many games next
season. So Rambis be prepared for a real long season. And always
remember “Be Careful What You Wish For For Wishes Can Come True!”
