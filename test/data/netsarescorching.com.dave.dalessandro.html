<p><em>Yup, it is another one of these interviews, I really think it is
interesting hearing the take of the beat writers that follow the
Nets.&nbsp; They are around the team the most, and they really seem to
know what makes a team tick (There are some questions in here about
Lawrence Frank’s job, this was done before Lawrence Frank was brought
back, I am just getting to posting it now).&nbsp; In this edition, I
sent a few questions Dave D’Alessandro’s way and he was kind enough to
answer them.&nbsp; Dave writes covers the Nets for The Star Ledger, you
can find his stuff over at his blog on NJ.com called Nets Blast.<br>
</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">—</p>
<p><strong>NAS:&nbsp; Looking back on it, was the Richard Jefferson trade a complete failure?</strong></p>
<p>No, I look at the RJ trade as a salary dump, because that’s what it
was. If they could catch lightning in a bottle by turning Yi into a
rotation player, then it’s a fair deal. But he’ll never be as good as
Jefferson, and everyone knew that already. Remember that three-game
stretch in January – 19 ppg, 7 rpg –&nbsp; that everyone watched in
slack-jawed amazement? Those were off-nights for Richard. Perhaps Yi
gets his averages up to that level someday – I wouldn’t say it’s beyond
the realm of possibility. And that will make some people say, “OK, not
a terrible deal.’ And those are the ones with short memories. Even
then, Yi cannot have the same impact on a game as RJ did – scoring,
boarding, passing for profit, defending, competing, inspiring – and he
never will.</p>
<p><strong>NAS:&nbsp; How impressed were you with the rookies this year?</strong></p>
<p>Muy impresionado, senor. Getting three contributors in one draft?
That’s extremely rare – someone ought to do the research to check the
last time it happened with a team that kept its original picks (I’m not
talking about getting Collins/RJ/Armstrong from Houston; I mean the
original picks). Usually a team that keeps its multiple picks gets one
really good player, another that sticks around for a bit, and a third
that bombs. Kind of a Charles Barkley-Leon Wood-Tom Sewell thing.</p>
<p><strong>NAS:&nbsp; I think we got a diamond in the rough with CDR.&nbsp; Do you think CDR can be a starter for the Nets someday?</strong></p>
<p>Don’t know if he’s a starter, but he’s a player. And once he becomes
a knockdown guy from 20 feet, he’ll be a very good player. I don’t
think it makes sense to wish for a guy to be a starter – this phase is
all about acquiring assets, and he can be a big one, especially if he
shows that he can play multiple possessions.<br>
<strong><br>
NAS:&nbsp; Would you consider the Nets season a failure?</strong></p>
<p>Hardly. We thought all along that the best-case scenario would be 35
wins, and 34-48 doesn’t exactly burst the balloon. People are probably
sick of hearing it, but Job 1 was developing the kids, and they
succeeded in most cases.</p>
<p><strong>NAS:&nbsp; What is your opinion on Vince Carter?&nbsp; Is he staying or going?</strong></p>
<p>This isn’t a matter of opinion, it’s a matter of opportunity. If
there’s a team out there that has some bad contracts it wants to dump
that add up to $16M, and the Nets can sell it by suggesting there’s an
asset in the deal that can help down the road without dropping them in
the sewer in ’09-10, they’ll pursue it. If not, they won’t.<br>
<strong><br>
NAS:&nbsp; Does Lawrence Frank need to go?&nbsp; If so, who would you like to see replace him?</strong></p>
<p>I’m old school on this. If you judge a coach on every facet of the
job – and the game strategy which most fans are fixated on is only
about 20 percent of it – you have to give him passing marks. Player
development, role definition, preparation, game-planning,
communication, attention to detail, temperament, accountability – he’s
not good, he’s very good. And in the end, if they’re playing hard for
him, that’s the only criterion to determine whether it’s time to make a
change. The only area in which I have my doubts is with relationships.
Don’t get me wrong – he hasn’t heard a hostile word since McInnis
dogged his way out of town. But I wonder whether there are times when
he may be too close to some of these guys. Yes, that’s the way it goes
in big-time politics – your survival is often intertwined with how your
best players feel about you. But I wonder if he is often too easy on
some guys, because some of them need a roundhouse kick in the kaboose –
I can’t tell you with any certainty, because I’m not allowed to watch
the practice interaction. I do know this much, however: This is not the
kind of self-motivated team he inherited in ’04 – it’s a very different
group. As for a replacement, you know the deal: Management usually goes
with a type that is the opposite in temperament, style, etc. It would
have to be a defensive guy – a Skiles type, but he’s otherwise engaged.
Van Gundy is probably going to stick with TV for the time being. I’ve
always wondered what a guy like Adelman would do with this group.
Thibodeau would be great, but he’s not exactly the most engaging
interview. And Eddie Jordan would be fine, but he’s not exactly a
defensive coach. And there’s nothing that I just said that Thorn hasn’t
thought about for hours at a time, which is why I think he’s going to
bring Frank back.</p>
<p><strong>NAS:&nbsp; Do you see the Nets going after any free agents?</strong></p>
<p>Not likely. The payroll is already as low as it can go, but
ownership actually wants it to go lower, regardless of what Bruce has
been saying. If they can pick off somebody for half the midlevel,
however (Bass? Kleiza?), Rod can probably sell it.<br>
<strong><br>
NAS:&nbsp; What do you think the Nets are going to do draft wise?</strong></p>
<p>Haven’t looked it yet. And I’m happy to report that they haven’t any
idea what they’re going to do draft-wise either, other than keep their
fingers crossed that there’s a space-and-glass eater available down at
11, because all they know right now is that Griffin/Rubio/Thabeet are
top 3 and everything else is a muddle.<br>
<strong><br>
NAS:&nbsp; Yi.&nbsp; Do you think he will be on the team next year?&nbsp; If so, is he just going to be riding the pine?</strong></p>
<p>Did you really say “riding the pine?” You know they actually sit in
cushy chairs now, right? Yes, he’ll be on the team next year, because
his trade value is nil. And he’ll be a sub unless he comes to camp 10
pounds heavier, 10 times more confident in his shooting stroke, twice
as strong, far more willing to take a hit and finish, automatic with
his face-up move from the elbow, 20 times more willing to take on a
defensive challenge, and generally pissed off at the world for laughing
at him over the last two months of ’08-09.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">—</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I just wanted to thank Dave again for
taking the time to answer my questions.&nbsp; It was interesting
reading his answers and getting his take on these topics.</p>

Batum started for all be 3 games.<br>
Oden played major minutes<br>
Rudy F was a key player off the bench.<br>
Jerrod Bayless was a key contributor when Blake went down with an injury.</p>

			<div class="ctext"><p>How
about Greg Oden, Rudy Fernandez and Nicolas Batum? Oden wasn’t great,
but he was still better than a lot of centers. Fernandez was awesome
most of the year and Batum started nearly every game for a 54 win team.
That’s a pretty good 3.</p>

			<div class="ctext"><p>Thanks
for the comment Dan. Yes all four of these players were considered
“rookies,” but they were not taken on the same draft night. Greg Oden
was drafted the year before, and Rudy F was signed last year I believe,
but came over this year. Dave was talking about having three players
taken in the same draft. That is much rarer because teams usually don’t
end up with three picks, and if they do, one usually comes up late in
the second round and does not contribute.</p>
<p>Again, thanks for the comment though.</p>

			<div class="ctext"><p>It
is cool don’t worry about it. Thanks a ton for the comment, but if you
check out my reply to Dan, I really don’t think the Trailblazers count
because only two of their players were actually taken during the 08
draft.</p>

			<div class="ctext"><p>Okay, the best Multiple person draft from a team is the 1986 Rookie Class of the Cleveland Cavaliers.</p>
<p>They drafted Brad Daugherty with the first pick in the draft. Ron
Harper with the 8th pick in the draft, and made a draft day trad with
the Dallas Mavericks for the 25th pick and chose Mark Price.</p>
<p>Daugherty: 5 time NBA All-Star. 1 year 3rd team all NBA. Retired at 28 with Back Problems. Sad.</p>
<p>Harper: Played 15 years 10 of which after losing all of his explosiveness post-knee surgery.<br>
Price: 4 time All Star, once was 1st team all NBA.</p>
<p>The Cavs also drafted Johnny Newman in the second round. He played 16 seasons, most notably with the Knicks.</p>
<p>You could also include John “Hot Rod” Williams, who was drafted in 85, but played in 86 as a rookie.</p>
<p>Now THAT is a draft.</p>
