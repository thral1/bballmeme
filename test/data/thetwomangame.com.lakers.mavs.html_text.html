The thing about establishing a goal and a corresponding brightline
is that you need to be prepared to fall short of it.  Obviously
that’s not the preferred result, but even the most worthy competitors
need to eventually brace themselves for the possibility of failure.
That may be what stings most about Sunday’s loss in Los
Angeles.  The Mavs no doubt realized that this was the toughest
game on their four-game road trip, and if there was a spot to drop a
loss, this would be it.  Yet the Mavs hung around, enduring an
inspired first half performance from Pau Gasol (or a lackluster
performance from the Mavs’ defense, take your pick), and took the lead
at the 8:49 mark in the 4th quarter.
The Mavs, those with flaws much deeper than their bench, overcame a
15 point deficit and had extended a lead of as much as 5 points. 
This could have been the season’s defining moment, a point at which
everything the team hopes to accomplish and the often troublesome
product they have fielded thus far come to a sharp divergence. 
This was a team on the brink of creating something beautiful on a
Sunday afternoon on national television.  But, as you know now, it
wasn’t to be.
With a little help from his friends, Antoine Wright actually
smothered Kobe into an 0-4 first quarter.  It was only fitting
that Kobe put similar shackles on the hot-handed Jason Terry to
effectively end the Mavs’ run in the fourth, shift the momentum
considerably as the Mavs struggled to dribble the ball cleanly, much
less score.
Still, one has to ask why exactly Jason Kidd is taking the biggest
shots of the game, and why exactly our star point guard is committing
silly ball-handling errors and careless turnovers on overambitious
passes.  The great points of the league can see the angles no one
else can see, and make the passes no one else can make; part of that
comes from pure ability, and the other part comes from the will to
complete those types of passes.  Kidd showed every bit of that
will, but maybe he was a little too willing to attempt to thread the
needle through three defenders on the break when a lob or kick-out
would have done just fine.
The defense continues to be the problem.  In the first half,
the Mavs were getting good looks, but just failed to capitalize. 
Meanwhile on the other end, Pau Gasol was having his way, three point
shooters were left wide open, and Kobe Bryant eventually remembered
that he is, in fact, Kobe Bryant.  The Mavs again show a complete
inability to defend any player on the floor that could be described as
‘quick,’ and the man defense was sliced and diced on the way to a
66-point first half for L.A..  But there is a bright spot
defensively: the zone continues to baffle opponents.  It’s
effectiveness would no doubt dwindle in a playoff series, in which
coaching staffs (staves) can tech and teach specifically to counter
it.  In the regular season, on the other hand, it’s managed to
slow down two of the league’s most potent offenses while only
surrendering one key weakness against the Lakers: the lack of
rebounding in the clutch.  Lamar Odom turned excellent defensive
possessions for the Mavs into entirely too many opportunities for the
Lakers.  Of course when the Mavs went away from the zone to secure
more rebounds, the Lakers just beat them outright.  Fun.
It’s also definitely worth noting that the zone is a vicegrip for
opposing second units.  The Mavs bench isn’t particularly skilled
defensively, but what they lack in talent and fundamentals on that end
they make up for in hustle.  Barea, Singleton, and Bass, coupled
with say Antoine Wright and Jason Terry, can smother opponents’ bench
lineups that lack the sort of penetrating playmaker needed to make
smart passes against the zone.  We saw this in full effect against
the Lakers sans Kobe, and equally so with the Blazers sans a healthy
Brandon Roy.
Dirk played very poorly by his standards.  His shot was off the
entire night, and this may be the first game of the season where the
Mavs came back to make things interesting in spite of him.  Credit
that to Jason Terry, who made an absolutely batty seven threes. 
Ultimately, it wasn’t enough, and this one stings more than a game that
just slipped through our fingers.

The thing about establishing a goal and a corresponding brightline

is that you need to be prepared to fall short of it. Obviously

that’s not the preferred result, but even the most worthy competitors

need to eventually brace themselves for the possibility of failure.

That may be what stings most about Sunday’s loss in Los

Angeles. The Mavs no doubt realized that this was the toughest

game on their four-game road trip, and if there was a spot to drop a

loss, this would be it. Yet the Mavs hung around, enduring an

inspired first half performance from Pau Gasol (or a lackluster

performance from the Mavs’ defense, take your pick), and took the lead

at the 8:49 mark in the 4th quarter.

The Mavs, those with flaws much deeper than their bench, overcame a

15 point deficit and had extended a lead of as much as 5 points.

This could have been the season’s defining moment, a point at which

everything the team hopes to accomplish and the often troublesome

product they have fielded thus far come to a sharp divergence.

This was a team on the brink of creating something beautiful on a

Sunday afternoon on national television. But, as you know now, it
