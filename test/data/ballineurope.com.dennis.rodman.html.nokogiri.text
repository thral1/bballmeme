Dennis
Rodman is returning to Europe, this time as the main headliner of a
group of NBA Legends for a European tour in November 2009.

The first planned event will take place on November 13, 2009, at the Sportpaleis in Antwerp, Belgium.
And another sports Belgian sports site said organiser Geert Baeyens is hoping to get games scheduled in England, Germany, France, Spain and Italy.
Other players listed to participate in the NBA Legends event are
Tracy Murray, Lamond Murray, AC Green, Shawn Kemp, Stacey Augmon, Norm
Nixon, Darwin Cook, John Starks, Kenny Anderson, Oliver Miller, Stanley
Roberts, Moses Malone, Robert Reid, Orlando Woolridge, Johnny Egan,
Rodney McCray, Darryl Dawkins, Spud Webb, Dee Brown, Dominique Wilkins
and Gerald Wilkins.
The second release called the event “Scottie Pippen & his
NBA-Legends”. But Pippen apparently has pulled out, as the Sportpaleis
website said Rodman has replaced Pippen.
Rodman will actually be making a return to Europe. He played one
game for the Finnish first division team Torpan Pojat on November 6,
2005. Later that season he played three games for the English team
Brighton Bears.
Rodman also played two exhibition games in the Philippines in spring
2006 along with former NBA stars Darryl Dawkins, Kevin Willis, Calvin
Murphy, Otis Birdsong and Alex English.
