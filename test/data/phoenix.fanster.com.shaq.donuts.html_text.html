to the newest dieting craze sweeping… well Facebook and Twitter. 
It is called the ShaqLyte diet. It is run by Suns’ Shaquille O’Neal,
and from what I can tell there are no real rules to the diet, it’s all
about what works for you. You just can’t cheat on what works for you
(kind of like the premise of marriage and we know how well that works
for 50% of America). 
Simple enough right? Anything that you make your own rules to should be pretty easy… 
Well, it seems like the Big Dieter may be struggling with his own
system as he posted a 1:30 video of him going one-on-one with a box of
Krispy Kreme donuts. The video consists of Shaq trying to eat said
donuts, but missing his mouth and fighting himself not to eat them. The
only message is “Don’t break the diet”, which appears at the very end
of the vignette. 
I’m not sure whether to find this video funny, confusing, or just
plain weird. Which ironically is my feelings on the ShaqLyte diet as
well. As I have told a few people, call me when Shaq shows up in
training camp at 250 pounds and then we can talk about this great new
fad.
