					Based on the Clippers recent free agent
targets, it’s natural to assume that the guard position is the biggest
need. After all, the Clippers only have 3 *true* guards on their
roster, and all we’ve heard for the last month is an overload of
Sessions talk mixed with an occasional A.I. flare up.  The
acquiring of a defensive minded wing, for the time being, has
apparently drifted out of focus.
Management has done nothing thus far to address the glaring needs on
the wing, and Dunleavy appears content with starting Al Thornton again
next year. Thornton played the lion’s share of the minutes last year at small forward, so let’s take a look at the Clippers production by position numbers compiled by 82games.com.

The first thing that pops out at you is how absolutely atrocious the
shot selection of Baron Davis was last year, but you likely didn’t need
a chart to come to that conclusion. The next thing that jumps off the
page is all the negatives in the small forward column. The Clippers
small forwards last year got out rebounded by a margin of 2.4 rebounds
per game, and the shooting guards weren’t much better, losing the
rebounding battle by 2 rebounds a game. That’s a -4.4 rebounding margin
on the wing, which is absolutely awful. Eric Gordon is an expected poor
rebounder at 6′3, but Al Thornton has all the physical tools to at
least be serviceable. Instead, he’s one of the worst in the league at his position.
The Clippers small forwards assist margin was the worst of the 5
positions. The small forwards also got outscored by opponents to the
tune of 2.8 points a game, which was the second worst position total on
the team. Hollinger’s PER system is less than perfect, but it is
telling that the Clippers’ small forwards were 4.7 PER points worse
than the opposition, which was by far the lowest total of the 5
positions. Based on these stats, the small forward position was where
the Clippers were outmatched most often last season.
Going forward, Gordon will desperately need a good rebounder and
defender on the wing next to him to cover up for his lack of size. Al
Thornton doesn’t appear to be that guy, as his skills just don’t seem
to mesh well with the rest of the young core. If the Clippers are
serious about contending this year and in the future, they simply have
to upgrade the starting small forward position. Players who are
primarily scorers at the small forward position just aren’t on
championship caliber teams. Looking back at the NBA Champions of this
decade reveals a slew of starting defensive minded small forwards:
Los Angeles Lakers, 2000 – Glen Rice was the starter, but Rick Fox played a valuable defensive role off the bench.
Los Angeles Lakers, 2001 – Rick Fox
Los Angeles Lakers, 2002 – Rick Fox and Devean George
San Antonio Spurs, 2003 – Bruce Bowen
Detroit Pistons, 2004 – Tayshaun Prince
San Antonio Spurs, 2005 – Bruce Bowen
Miami Heat, 2006 – James Posey
San Antonio Spurs, 2007 – Bruce Bowen
Boston Celtics, 2008 - Paul Pierce was the starter, but James Posey played lots of crucial minutes.
Los Angeles Lakers, 2009 – Trevor Ariza
What do all these players have in common? First, they all have the
height (6′7 or above) to shut down every type of perimeter player.
Second, they can all knock down the corner 3 with consistency. It’s
overly simplistic, but that’s basically the requirements of a “glue
guy”. Al Thornton, despite his immense talent, currently meets neither
of these requirements.
The promising thing for the Clippers is that “glue guys” can be
found anywhere. Bruce Bowen bounced around the league and played for 4
different teams before finally landing in San Antonio. James Posey
followed the same path as well, playing for 4 different teams before
landing in Miami. Devean George was drafted out of a Division III
college. Trevor Ariza was acquired last season for Brian freaking Cook.
Some Clippers fans believe that wing player Mardy Collins can fill that defensive role for this team. Collins may
be a good enough defender, but he’ll need to develop something that at
least resembles a jumper before reaching true “glue guy” status.
Witness:
In his nine games as a Los Angeles Clipper, Collins has
taken 29 shot attempts from the floor.  Only ten of them have been
successful, while 13 of the 29 haven’t drawn iron. -December 15th, 2008.
Mardy Collins, and for that matter, Al Thornton, may eventually
develop into prominent defensive stoppers with the ability to stretch
the defense, but both clearly have a long way to go.
So where is the next championship level perimeter defender and
shooter hiding? He could be anywhere…but the Clippers will never find
him unless they start looking.
