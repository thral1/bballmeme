<p><strong>“Better late than never…right guys?”<br>
-Roberticus Mahoney</strong></p>
<p>The thing about <a href="http://www.thetwomangame.com/2009/03/no-game-is-an-island-the-finish-line-is-just-around-the-bend/">establishing a goal and a corresponding brightline</a>
is that you need to be prepared to fall short of it.&nbsp; Obviously
that’s not the preferred result, but even the most worthy competitors
need to eventually brace themselves for the possibility of failure.</p>
<p>That may be what stings most about Sunday’s loss in Los
Angeles.&nbsp; The Mavs no doubt realized that this was the toughest
game on their four-game road trip, and if there was a spot to drop a
loss, this would be it.&nbsp; Yet the Mavs hung around, enduring an
inspired first half performance from Pau Gasol (or a lackluster
performance from the Mavs’ defense, take your pick), and took the lead
at the 8:49 mark in the 4th quarter.</p>
<p>The Mavs, those with flaws much deeper than their bench, overcame a
15 point deficit and had extended a lead of as much as 5 points.&nbsp;
This could have been the season’s defining moment, a point at which
everything the team hopes to accomplish and the often troublesome
product they have fielded thus far come to a sharp divergence.&nbsp;
This was a team on the brink of creating something beautiful on a
Sunday afternoon on national television.&nbsp; But, as you know now, it
wasn’t to be.</p>
<p>With a little help from his friends, Antoine Wright actually
smothered Kobe into an 0-4 first quarter.&nbsp; It was only fitting
that Kobe put similar shackles on the hot-handed Jason Terry to
effectively end the Mavs’ run in the fourth, shift the momentum
considerably as the Mavs struggled to dribble the ball cleanly, much
less score.</p>
<p>Still, one has to ask why exactly Jason Kidd is taking the biggest
shots of the game, and why exactly our star point guard is committing
silly ball-handling errors and careless turnovers on overambitious
passes.&nbsp; The great points of the league can see the angles no one
else can see, and make the passes no one else can make; part of that
comes from pure ability, and the other part comes from the will to
complete those types of passes.&nbsp; Kidd showed every bit of that
will, but maybe he was a little too willing to attempt to thread the
needle through three defenders on the break when a lob or kick-out
would have done just fine.</p>
<p>The defense continues to be the problem.&nbsp; In the first half,
the Mavs were getting good looks, but just failed to capitalize.&nbsp;
Meanwhile on the other end, Pau Gasol was having his way, three point
shooters were left wide open, and Kobe Bryant eventually remembered
that he is, in fact, Kobe Bryant.&nbsp; The Mavs again show a complete
inability to defend any player on the floor that could be described as
‘quick,’ and the man defense was sliced and diced on the way to a
66-point first half for L.A..&nbsp; But there is a bright spot
defensively: the zone continues to baffle opponents.&nbsp; It’s
effectiveness would no doubt dwindle in a playoff series, in which
coaching staffs (staves) can tech and teach specifically to counter
it.&nbsp; In the regular season, on the other hand, it’s managed to
slow down two of the league’s most potent offenses while only
surrendering one key weakness against the Lakers: the lack of
rebounding in the clutch.&nbsp; Lamar Odom turned excellent defensive
possessions for the Mavs into entirely too many opportunities for the
Lakers.&nbsp; Of course when the Mavs went away from the zone to secure
more rebounds, the Lakers just beat them outright.&nbsp; Fun.</p>
<p>It’s also definitely worth noting that the zone is a vicegrip for
opposing second units.&nbsp; The Mavs bench isn’t particularly skilled
defensively, but what they lack in talent and fundamentals on that end
they make up for in hustle.&nbsp; Barea, Singleton, and Bass, coupled
with say Antoine Wright and Jason Terry, can smother opponents’ bench
lineups that lack the sort of penetrating playmaker needed to make
smart passes against the zone.&nbsp; We saw this in full effect against
the Lakers sans Kobe, and equally so with the Blazers sans a healthy
Brandon Roy.</p>
<p>Dirk played very poorly by his standards.&nbsp; His shot was off the
entire night, and this may be the first game of the season where the
Mavs came back to make things interesting in spite of him.&nbsp; Credit
that to Jason Terry, who made an absolutely batty seven threes.&nbsp;
Ultimately, it wasn’t enough, and this one stings more than a game that
just slipped through our fingers.</p>

			<p>Why
is Kidd taking the big shots? How many times has Kidd made a big three
or a big play in the Mavs 40 wins? Have you not seen that? Or your just
one of the “Devin Harris is having an All-Star year, blah blah blah and
should not have been traded for an aging point guard” group? Well, that
aging point guard has won a lot of games for the Mavs. And again, if
you still don’t get it. Harris would not be an All-Star with Dallas.
And oh, where are the Nets right now?… My point exactly!</p>

			<p>Kidd’s
big plays have been spot-up threes and steals. I’m comfortable with him
doing either one of those things. But when he’s losing his dribble
bringing the ball up the court and taking off-balance mid-range jumpers
with the game on the line, I’m gonna have to say my piece.</p>
<p>Not every criticism of Jason Kidd has something to do with Devin Harris.</p>

			<p>With
Kidd you have to accept that there will be turnovers sometimes, and
he’s been surprisingly good at keeping that in check this season. I
think more credit goes to the Lakers defense than anything else. </p>
<p>The Lakers defense won the game, Jason Kidd shouldn’t take midrange
jumpers, but Dirk wasn’t getting it going and JET was being smothered
by Kobe. Would’ve been great if we had that other option…calling JHo.</p>

			<p>Kidd
has won or kept us in numerous games this season, but the criticism he
received for this game was fully warranted. He is not a viable scoring
option, accept it. Like was said, yes he has knocked down a dagger 3
for us on a few occassions. But how many of those were contested, hand
in the face, falling away 3s? I dare you to find more than one, as even
a blind squirrel finds a nut every once in a while and I’m sure there
is one out there somewhere. That shot, the air tight defense/game on
the line shot, can right now go only to two men on this basketball team
- JET or Dirk. Kidd’s job as an NBA veteran and unarguably one of the
greatest PGs to ever play the game is to create a play to get them the
ball with at least a milisecond of time to catch and shoot. Clearly, he
was not able to do that. Kobe’s “body glove” defense aside, Trevor
Ariza’s hustle aside, there should be no reason why we squander a 6 pt
lead while missing 8 of 9 shots on bad looks. We settled for shots, had
horrible turnovers; and, since Kidd runs this offense, the blame is
partly on him. You want the credit? Get ready to take the blame when
going gets tough.</p>
<p>Assuming any and all criticism of Kidd is synonymous with an outcry
for Devin Harris to please come back is ludicrous. Yes, Dirk was
passive and was not looking to shoot the ball as much as he should
have. Yes, Kobe was doing his best impression of a Bruce Bowen/Shane
Battier uber-defender on speed. But if you have 10,000 assists and are
regarded as a 1st ballot HoFer, you cant make silly thread-the-needle
turnovers, or get the ball stolen from you by a second year (or
whatever, screw Ariza) player when your team is down by 1 with 4 min
left.</p>

			<p>Let’s
be fair now, how many times have we put Kidd’s name next to the words
“careless turnover” this season? Not much. The guy has been much more

			<p>I
think one game with a few miscues against a suffocating Lakers defense
is excusable. Frankly, If Dirk showed up JET and Jkidd wouldn’t have
had such a hard time with execution. </p>
<p>JKidd didn’t take those shots because he wanted to, JET tried to run
the two man game with Dirk in the fourth but he was forced out of the
play over and over again by an overzealous Kobe.</p>

			<p>Pretty terrible news; thoughts go out to Landry and his family.</p>
<p>Losing Landry hurts their chances quite a bit, and likely means that
the Rox are going to be playing Hayes substantially more. Which
is…interesting, to say the least. I won’t discount what that team has
been able to accomplish in spite of significant injuries by counting
them out just yet, but their road just got significantly bumpier.</p>

			<p>I
don’t disagree. Kidd knows better than to think that he is the first,
second, or even third offensive option. It was just unfortunate that he
needed to take those shots. Personally, I would’ve even preferred a
cold Dirk launching ze jumpers. You never know when Dirk will suddenly
find his stroke and win you a game (Philly comes to mind).</p>
<p>But man, was Kobe brilliant defensively during that final stretch or what?</p>

			<p>definitively.
not taking anytihng away from Kobe, broskie was money down the stretch.
but to echo Rob’s thoughts, I’d much rather lose by seeing Dirk miss
contested and off-balance shots than see Kidd do the same. yes Dirk was
covered and yes so was JET, but it’s not like JKidd was launching
bricks while wide open. Any shot would be a contested one, that’s my
beef with Kidd guys. If you realize the shot wont come easy, get it in
the hands of a man who gets paid to score.</p>

			<p>Kidd
isn’t an offensive half court player, he stands in the corner and
shoots open 3s. This would be like if the lakers were running
Walton/Gasol instead of Kobe/Gasol down the stretch.<br>
If Kobe was shutting down Jet why not run Dirk iso at the top of the
key and surround him with shooters. Somebody needs to show Rick
Carlisle some 2004-2007 Mavs footage when we ran that play all the time
and it made us a title contender.</p>
