Here are some links about your Detroit Pistons that might keep you busy while you're at work wondering where the weekend went.
If you want to get to know more of my opinion regarding the Pistons, Patrick Hayes of MLIVE'sIt's Just Sportsinterviewed mefor
his "Better Know a Blogger" series about the start of this blog and the
team. If you're interested in hearing what I think about the
off-season moves, my expectations for the upcoming season, and which
Pistons player is most entertaining on Twitter, amongst other topics,
thenclick over to read.
Last week CharlieVillanueva held a contest for fansto submit photoshopped pictures via twitter of what he would look like with hair. CV31has alopecia which caused him to lose most, if not all, of the hair on his body. On Friday morning, he announced the five finalists and winner of the contest on ESPN's First Take.
The Pistons just signed Ben Wallace, reportedly to add extra leadership qualities to the team. It might wind up working out, butRodney Stuckey wants to be Detroit's leader. Matt Watson at Fan House hasthe storyfor you. 
Actions speak louder than words and if Rodney Stuckey is going to bark that he wants to be the team leader, he's going to need to bite. TheFree Press reports that his actions have matched his words--
throughout the off-season, Stuckey has spoken on behalf of the team and
he plans on proving his desire to be a leader on the court come
fall.
John Kuester has openly stated that he wantsRichard Hamilton and Tayshaun Prince to be the leaders on the team.
This makes the most sense because they have actually been through
the ups and the little downs Detroit has experienced over roughly the
past decade. Kuester also maintained thatRip will resume his role as a starter,but he and Ben Gordon will both see their fair share of starter minutes. 
BenGordon spoke with a radio station in Chicagoand
helped shed some light on what Coach John Kuester has in store for
Detroit's new offense. It sounds like Kuester is going to stress
an up tempo style, but will not forget the fundamentals on the
defensive end, either. (ViaDetroit Bad Boys)
As you know, Ben Wallace agreed to a one-year deal to return to the Pistons. Detroit4lyfe doesn't really understand why Detroit settled for the 35-year old who bailed on Detroit in 2006. Another Pistons blogger would agree --Life on Dumars calls the signing feloniousand wonders what other aging former-Pistons Detroit should bring back. 
Pistons Nationhas a great perspective on the Ben Wallace signing.
He warns fans to curb their enthusiasm as he breaks down the pros
and cons of Detroit re-signing Ben Wallace. Either way, whether
the signing is good or bad, hearing the Big Ben gong again will
definitely induce goosebumps.
Need4Sheedput
a creative spin on the Ben Wallace re-signing. Wallace will
reportedly receive $1.3 million, or the veterans minimum, which Natalie
says is so cheap that it has landedBen Wallace on the Taco Bell value menu. 
The
big question fans are wondering, almost more so than whether or not
he'll be productive at all, is what number Ben Wallace will don.
As you probably already know, Rodney Stuckey is No. 3 now, so
there might be a little drama if Wallace expects to have back the
number he wore for six seasons in Detroit. Anastute reader at Detroit Bad Boyspointed out a very interesting potential solution to the number issue. AsPistons Nationsaid, times are tough, you have to cut corners whenever you can.
Lastly, but certainly not least, Dave Dial of MLIVE'sFull Court Presstakes a statistical look at the 2009-2010 Detroit Pistons.
Judging from the in depth look at the stats, Detroit's offense
should put up a lot of points, but the rebounding numbers and defensive
outlook is nothing to call Grandma about. Either way, as Mr. Dial
states, it's going to be really exciting to see how this team comes
together. I can't wait for the season to start.  Can you?
