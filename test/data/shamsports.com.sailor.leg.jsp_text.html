      I feel obligated to write something about the Bulls/Celtics
series. It has been untold drama, brilliant excitement, and well worth
the fortnight of 7am finishes. It's been better than Megan Fox's
shadow, worse than De Niro's moustache in Cop Land, and awesome to a
fault. And I feel inclined to write something that describes it all.But
the truth is, I don't want to. I don't think I can. The series has been
so unilaterally brilliant, so unrivalled in its drama and so and
flawlessly flawed in its execution, that I'm not capable of writing the
words to accurately describe it. I don't think anyone is. It's as
though someone decided the Coach Carter series of films should rival
Police Academy, wrote seven of the most implausibly cheesy scripts ever
written, and nailed them all on the first take in front of an audience
of millions. The drama, for lack of a better word, is perfect.Disregard
game three for a minute. (The Bulls forgot to turn up to that one, so
it's best we pretend that it didn't happen.) Over the other 5 games,
the other 275 minutes, and the 1000 or so possessions, the difference
between the two team's aggregate score is 1 freaking point. There have
been 7 overtimes in 4 games, and one game that was decided in the final
second of regulation. Never before has there even been more than 2
overtime games in a series. And yet we're at 4 already, with one still
to play.It is almost unfathomable how close these two teams
are. It will never happen again. It doesn't matter now about the
peculiar series of events that made it this way; what we have now,
quite possibly, are the two most evenly matched teams in the sport's
history. All the planets have aligned, and this is the basketball
equinox.How many plays have there been that, if only minutely
different, would have meant the series was over by now? I mean,
seriously, how many things only had to go ever so slightly differently
for the result to be different? What if Rajon Rondo was called for the goaltend of Kirk Hinrich's layup? What if Eddie House knew where the three point line was? What if Ray Allen hadn't tiptoed it, twice? What if Ben Gordon didn't kick the cooler and get a technical? What if Joakim Noah didn't gamble for that steal? What if he missed it? Does Brian Scalabrine then get his Horry on? What if they called Paul Pierce dragging his pivot foot 6 yards in the first OT? What if this didn't happen;What if John Salmons doesn't take that airball three at the end of regulation? What if the moving screen on Glen Davis
that set up the House two was properly called? What if Hinrich hadn't
MISSED THAT FREAKING LAYUP?!?!?? What if Brad Miller had thrown a shot
up at the end of OT? What if Pierce hadn't turned down passing to an
open Allen? If Joakim Noah misses that gambled steal, does Scalabrine
put the Celtics up 126-123? What if Pierce hadn't fouled him?And those are just from the last 16 minutes of game 5. What about the other 287 in the series?Everything
that has happened in this series has happened in reverse, too. Brad
Miller has choked in the clutch and won a game down the stretch. Ben
Gordon has almost won games single handedly, and done his best to lose
them too. Derrick Rose
shows that he's ready for both the big time and bedtime. Kirk Hinrich,
one of the worst clutch performer of the decade (a man who shot 14% in the clutch
last season) has turned up for the big stage. Ray Allen has been
brilliant or non existent. Paul Pierce can gut out a win, but only
sometimes. Everyone has been brilliant for stretches and terrible in
others, coming (Tyrus Thomas
even went a game without sucking. That's rare.) The only consistencies
have been bad officiating, worse coaching, John Salmons's relentlessly
gormless "my beard is so heavy it's pulling my bottom jaw to the
ground" face, and Kevin Garnett's unabashed twatness. Just those and all the overtimes.And
then on top of that, we've had all the bonus drama. Rajon Rondo's
carnal desire to hurt someone. Kirk Hinrich's eternal swag. Ray Allen
being really, really, really, really good. Joakim Noah showing the
world what Bulls fans knew since January. The long overdue debut of Aaron Gray's playoff beard. Doug Collins's fluctuating opinions on how tall Ben Gordon is. Tony Allen's death threat. Kevin Garnett's injury. Ben Gordon's injury. Leon Powe's
terrible luck early in the series. The huge plays down the stretch. The
terrific individual execution. The knee bucklingly bad coaching. Brad
Miller's permanent "tickle me again and I'll throw a paddy right here
and now" scowl when things go badly. Vinny Del Negro's palms being
welded into his armpits. Stephon Marbury
losing games through being afraid to shoot. Brian Scalabrine getting
key minutes while sporting a head like an upside-down carrot cake.
Danny Ainge's heart attack. It's brilliant. I just only wish the stage was bigger.At
the end of game 6, I called my friend, finding myself with a desperate
need to explain to someone what I'd been watching. They probably didn't
appreciate the call at 7.45am on a weekday, but they got it anyway. I
tried to explain what I'd been watching, why I was so excited, where
this series placed in the all time history of the sport, how there'd
been so many if-onlys and impossible shots that even Matthew
McConaughey would have turned down the script. She didn't quite
understand, or even really try to. But she meant well when she said;"Congratulations."Thanks. Go Bulls.Labels: Brad Miller, Bulls, Celtics, Eddie House, Glen Davis, Joakim Noah, John Salmons, Kendrick Perkins, Kevin Garnett, Kirk Hinrich, Leon Powe, Rajon Rondo, Ray Allen, Stephon Marbury, Tyrus Thomas
