Exactly
how insane is the brain of the ultimate Laker fan during such a
devastating loss? So deranged, that I find myself having to steal
a quote from Clippers’ announcer Ralph Lawler - “Fasten your seat
belts!”

The nerves in my brain fire semi-related events. I flash back
to the 1980 NBA Finals. Magic’s rookie year, and he leads his
team to a championship. He wouldn’t have stood for this. I
flash to the future, and Lebron retires with 2 MVPs and 4 rings, one
more than Kobe. It’s Durant’s league now.
I start to panic. These Rockets are sticky. Their
defense is only matched by the quickness of Aaron Brooks. Derek
Fisher is helpless again, eating layups from a young guard that drops
19 points on him. Is that Jordan Farmar on the court? Wow,
he made a three-pointer. Oh no, we’re still down.

Yao Ming’s production = the sum of Gasol’s and Bynum’s
production. We are dead meat if that keeps happening. I
wonder if Kareem would meet me for lunch over this. Maybe he
could teach me to be more calm. When is Bill Walton’s kid going
to play again? You know, that curly haired slow guy that passed
the ball well.
If Sasha Vujacic overreacts to one more foul, I’m going to eat my fist.

Then, hope started to settle in. Game 7 is in Los
Angeles. The Rockets still have to go through Los Angeles
(assuming the Lakers actually win enough games to get to a game
7). Pau Gasol went 6-14 for 14 points. That won’t happen
again. The Lakers shot 2-18 from 3-point range (11%!). That
won’t happen again.
Kobe went absolutely off in the 2nd half to finish with 32 points, 8
rebounds, and 4 assists. But it didn’t matter. He had no
real help behind him. He didn’t get to the line enough.
Phil Jackson needs to hit the tape room with his team. Draw
fouls, post up Gasol more, make Bynum run a mile for every dumb foul he
keeps committing early in the game. Anything to avoid another
performance like this.

When Yao Ming bumped knees with Kobe, he got halfway to the locker
room before turning right back around to play. These Rockets want
to win, badly. The Lakers didn’t look like they did in game 1.
Yes, I bleed purple and gold. But I root for Yao Ming’s
health, and his heart of a champion. I realize the Rockets are
probably the best defensive team left in the playoffs. I hope for
a great series. Only not like this. My script said the
Lakers win. If I’m used to one thing in Hollywood, it’s
rewrites. I’m just not ready for the script to be rejected.
