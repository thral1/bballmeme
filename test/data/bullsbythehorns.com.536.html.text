Earthball (urth’-bahl) noun. An awkward,

graceless jump shot that defies standard ball rotation by spinning
sideways, much like the planet Earth. This shooting method was more
than likely devised by Joakim Noah. As inventions go, the Earthball
ranks right up there with dog sweaters, pay toilets and the electric
fork.
Usage example: Earthballs are ugly and
potentially dangerous to the backboard, opposing players and even small
children. But hey, any shot that goes in is a good shot, right?
Word history: The term was (as far as I can tell) coined by Mike McGraw of the Daily Herald in an article titled Noah’s ‘Earthball’ part of game plan … very small part.
Said McGraw: “Joakim Noah did something in Saturday’s victory over New
Orleans that he hadn’t even attempted in weeks — knock down an outside
jumper. His 16-footer struck nothing but net late in the first quarter
of the Bulls’ blowout win. ‘I know that’s not really my role to shoot
jump shots,’ Noah said following Monday’s practice at the Berto Center.
‘But if they’re giving me an opening like that, coach tells me to keep
the defense honest. I’m happy it went in.’ Noah launched his unorthodox
‘Earthball’ jumpers (the ball spins sideways, like a planet) on
occasion as a rookie, but they have been a rare sight this season.
Coach Vinny Del Negro consented that he made room for such a play in
the game plan.
“‘He owes me money,’ Del Negro joked. ‘He works hard, so I’m going
to throw him an opportunity, and it worked. When a guy works as hard as
Joakim does, I’m going to give him a jump shot here and there. If it
goes in we’re all going to smile, and if it doesn’t you guys are all
going to say, ‘Why would the coach allow him to take that jump shot?’
It went in the other night and it went in today in practice, but I
don’t want him to get carried away with that too much.’”
Uh, Vinny, can you give Tyrus Thomas that same piece of advice, please?
