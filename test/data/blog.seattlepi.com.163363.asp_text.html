BARSTOW, Calif. -- Left Yreka, Calif., at
6:30 this morning and arrived here at the beautiful Barstow Super 8 at
10:30 this evening after 650 miles of driving and a few stops, the
first in Sacramento to interview Spencer Hawes, the subject of Wednesday's column.
Hawes was in good spirits and talkative as usual. I also spoke with
Kings strength coach Daniel Shapiro, who is best friends with Andrew Moritz, a former Husky who is battling cancer and the subject of last Monday's column.
The Kings are the worst team in the league and I had no idea who the
coach was until someone pointed him out and told me he was Kenny Natt.
Enjoyed talking to him about Hawes. Then spent maybe 20 minutes with
Hawes, who was his quotable self.
When I left, I reminisced about the great rivalry the Sonics had
with the Kings in the 1990s. Hard to believe the Kings are the worst
team in the NBA and the Sonics don't even exist anymore.
As I drove out of the Arco Arena parking lot, I thought back to
those days of covering the Sonics. I was a beat writer from 1990-96,
and in that final year, or maybe it was the year before, I forget, and
it's late ... anyway, this was the site of my worst-ever conflict with
an athlete in my 26 years at the P-I.
Figured now is as good a time as any to tell you what happened ...
First round of the NBA playoffs, Sonics vs. Kings. Sonics win the
first game at KeyArena but lose the second and head to Sacramento for
Game 3. They were coming off two consecutive first-round eliminations
against Denver and the Lakers, and everyone in town thought they were
going to flame out again.
At any rate, we found out that Gary Payton had to go to the hospital
after Game 2 because he was so dehydrated he needed intravenous fluids.
Thought that was a good story ... something along the lines of "Sonics
lost, but their leader played so hard that he had to go to the
hospital." So I pursued it before Game 3 in Sacramento.
Went into the Sonics' locker room at Arco Arena before the game and
asked Payton about it. He was tying his shoes and looked up at me and
said: "What's that got to do with basketball?" I repeated the story,
told him that it just showed a lot about him to play his heart out to
the point that he had to go to the hospital, etc. "What's that got to
do with basketball?" he repeated. I tried one more time to get him to
play along and got one more "What's that got to do with basketball?"
And then after years of growing tired of dealing with him, I got fed up
and instead of walking away with my tail between my legs like I'd done
so many times before, I said: "You know what, Gary? I'm sick of your
(bleep)."
He got up and got right in my face and said: "So what are you gonna do about it?"
Quickly, I thought to myself, Jesus, I don't know what I'm going to do
about it, but I can't back down now. I noticed that he had just brushed
his teeth and there was a little toothpaste in the corner of his mouth,
so I pointed to the corner of his mouth and said: "Hey, Gary, you've
got a little toothpaste in the corner of your mouth."
To this day, I have no idea why I said that. I just didn't have an
answer to "So what are you gonna do about it?" I knew I couldn't say:
"I'm gonna kick your butt" because I was a flabby 39-year-old
sportswriter at the time and he was 26 and chiseled and no doubt would
have beaten the hell out of me.
His response to the toothpaste comment was this: He came at me with an
overhand right that was intercepted by either Sam Perkins or David
Wingate, thankfully, because it no doubt would have hurt my face. 
Then George Karl bear hugged me, to prevent me from charging Payton,
figuring I had plans to do that, which I didn't. Then Payton and I just
shouted "Bleep yous!" back and forth to each other before I was
escorted out of the locker room.
My punishment: I couldn't talk to Payton for 48 hours, which meant no
Payton comments in my stories for two whole days. I didn't mind that at
all. And I'm sure he didn't either. 
To his credit, from that day forward and through the NBA Finals, we had
a decent professional relationship. But I always did better with him
when other reporters asked questions and I listened in. Five or six
years later when I covered the team again for one year, he was great.
Now if I were to see him, I'd hope that it would be a case of no hard
feelings. But I do know this: He wasn't my favorite player, and I sure
as heck know that I wasn't his favorite reporter either.
BACK TO THE ROAD TRIP: Once again, for the second consecutive day,
nothing of interest happened. Willie my golden retriever ran around the
Arco Arena parking lot chasing tennis balls and barked at other dogs
outside the Lost Hills, Calif., Denny's, where I spent a couple of
hours writing the Hawes column.
Should make it to Peoria tomorrow unless I take a detour to Las Vegas, which is less than two hours from here.
