health, and his heart of a champion.  I realize the Rockets are
probably the best defensive team left in the playoffs.  I hope for
a great series.  Only not like this.  My script said the
Lakers win.  If I’m used to one thing in Hollywood, it’s
rewrites.  I’m just not ready for the script to be rejected.

I'm So Distraught After the Lakers Loss, I'm Stealing Quotes From Ralph Lawler

The nerves in my brain fire semi-related events. I flash back

to the 1980 NBA Finals. Magic’s rookie year, and he leads his

team to a championship. He wouldn’t have stood for this. I

flash to the future, and Lebron retires with 2 MVPs and 4 rings, one

more than Kobe. It’s Durant’s league now.

Fisher is helpless again, eating layups from a young guard that drops

19 points on him. Is that Jordan Farmar on the court? Wow,

he made a three-pointer. Oh no, we’re still down.
