The defending Eastern Conference champion Orlando Magic will be without Rashard Lewis for the first 10 games of the 2009-10 season, after the All-Star power forward tested positive for what the league said was "an elevated testosterone level."
The 6-10, 230-pound Lewis, an integral part of the Magic's run to the NBA Finals against the eventual champion Los Angeles Lakers, issued a statement claiming that he took an over-the-counter supplement "toward the end of the season." 
"First and foremost I take full responsibility for the situation and accept the corresponding penalty. Toward the end of the season I took an over-the-counter supplement, which at the time I did not realize included a substance banned by the NBA. I apologize to Magic fans, my teammates and this organization for not doing the research that should come with good judgment," Lewis said in the statement. 
The Orlando Sentinel reported that the supplement contained the drug dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), a hormone that has anabolic or muscle-building effects, but which has a lower potency than other steroids and steroid precursors. 
DHEA is banned by the NBA, but not by Major League Baseball, and continues to be a means for baseball players to gain an edge on the diamond without risking testing positive. Some dispute DHEA's effectiveness, however. 
"We've sold maybe two bottles of DHEA in the last four years," says Steve Cardillo, the owner of American Nutrition Center supplement store in Everett, Mass. Cardillo has been in the supplement industry for more than 20 years. "It does nothing. The amount you'd have to do for any real effect would have to be huge." 
The NBA conducts four random drug tests between Oct. 1 and June 30 (including the preseason). Second-time offenders for using performance-enhancing drugs are suspended 25 games, and third-time offenders banned for a year. A fourth positive test results in dismissal from the league. 
Lewis, who turns 30 tomorrow, averaged 19 points during the playoffs. His suspension will cost him approximately $2 million of his $18.9 million salary for this season. 
Lewis is not the first NBA player to violate the league's drug-testing policy, although the number of positive drug tests for performance-enhancing drugs is small. Other NBA players suspended for PED use include Don MacLean, Matt Geiger and Soumaila Samake.
