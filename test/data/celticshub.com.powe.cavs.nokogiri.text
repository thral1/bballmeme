The great Woj is reporting (on Twitter, natch) that the Cavs are going to sign Leon Powe
to a one-year deal worth the veteran’s minimum with a team option for a
second year, provided Cleveland’s doctors don’t find anything
unexpected wrong with Powe’s knee/s.
The deal could be done as soon as tomorrow (Tuesday).
Well, that’s going to be a little uncomfortable, isn’t it? I told you how I feel about Leon
in my farewell post a few weeks ago, and I suspect many of you feel the
same. And now we may be in the awkward position of rooting for Powe
while simultaneously rooting against his team. I guess it’s no more
awkward than a million fantasy baseball dilemmas that pop up every
night, but this is actual real life with real teams and real
players.
Ugh. Let’s at least hope we don’t see this scenario play out.
Good luck, Leon. I hope you pass your physical, stay healthy and
leave Cleveland in two seasons for a much more lucrative deal somewhere
else.
