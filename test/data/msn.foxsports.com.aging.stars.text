After exploring what might be expected next season from several of the almost-elite young players, next up are the aging all-stars.  

Which of these geezers have any gas left in their tanks, and which are
just tanked? Why have some of them aged more gracefully than others?
And what are the immediate prospects for these post-prime players, all
of whom will be at least 34 when next season begins?Since both Shaquille O'Neal (age 37) and Zydrunas Ilgauskas (34)
are their only offensive-minded centers, the Cavaliers are more
dependent than any other team on getting optimal performances from
their geriatric players.Shaq, of course, enjoyed a
semi-miraculous resurrection under the care of Phoenix's extraordinary
training staff. Yet even though he remained sufficiently healthy to
play in 75 games last season (the most since the 1998-99 season), both
his lateral movement and his hops continued to be seriously
compromised. The Cavs can expect Shaq to be as immobile as the Statue
of Liberty, but still powerful enough to make opponents' feet slide
when they try to post-up. He'll also set Gargantuan screens, make some
nifty passes out of the pivot, but make even more errant ones. Because
of his total loss of speed and quickness, Shaq will always be in, or on
the verge of, foul trouble.However, if he can come close to
duplicating last season's numbers — 75 games, 30 minutes and 17.8
points per outing — then the Cavs will indeed be one of the NBA's elite
ball clubs.But don't count on it. Back in 2002, Shaq underwent a
procedure called a "cheilectomy", which involved a cleaning out of bone
spurs and arthritic debris from his right big toe. In the ensuing years
since the surgery, podiatrists agree that the joint has necessarily
undergone further disintegration. "He's got to be hurting big
time," said one doctor, "especially with the unusual stress on the
joint that a 300-plus pound individual playing professional basketball
creates game-after-game. It's a miracle that he hasn't totally broken
down already, but he undoubtedly will. Sooner rather than later Shaq is
going to need a surgical fusion and the insertion of a plate to
maintain the joint's integrity. Such a procedure would put him on the
shelf for at least six months and likely end his career. Meanwhile,
he's at great risk."The point is that Shaq, more than any of his age-challenged peers, is playing/running/walking on borrowed time.

Ilgauskas has had his own footsie problems in the
past, but the surgical insertion of various pins have successfully
stabilized his ankles and are in no immediate danger of disintegrating.
That said, the Z-Man has lost whatever lateral mobility he had, is
incapable of posting up stronger opponents, can't defend anybody, and
has been reduced to being a 7-3 jump shooter. However, playing
18-20 minutes behind Shaq could be a boon for Ilgauskas. That's because
on offense he would only be involved in high screen/fades, thereby
generating open jumpers for himself ,and also leaving the middle open
for LeBron's powerhouse drives. With his daylight limited, Ilguaskas
won't have to "save" his fouls and can be much more aggressive on
defense — particularly in attacking shots in the paint.Besides, there's always the offensively-challenged Anderson Varejao to do the heavy lifting on defense.Still,
maintaining the health and relative mobility of both Shaq and Ilgauskas
are critical to the Cavs' championship hopes. If Zydrunas goes down,
then Shaq's playing time will necessarily increase, putting the Big
Load further at risk.If Shaq goes down, then Cleveland will be stuck with the same kind of lopsided squad that it fielded last season.  Grant Hill (37):
Here's another old-timer whose career has been rescued by the Suns'
trainers. As such, there's no reason why he can't reprise the 29.8
minutes and 12.0 points per game that he registered last season. In
fact, with Alvin Gentry intent on reviving the Suns' speedball game
plan, Hill just might be even more effective. Moreover, Hill's habitual
turnovers and slow-footed defense won't even be noticed as the Suns
race up and down the court.Despite his age, Hill's various
injuries have compelled him to miss the equivalent of nearly eight full
seasons during his career. So Hill's odometer is still only 29 years
old. Steve Nash (35): When Shaq was on board, the Suns
were forced to play much more half-court offense than they had in the
past. For Nash, this meant a quantum increase in physical contact and a
six-year low in his minutes played, as well as his assist and point
totals. 
The next step





With the Suns on the run again, Nash will be able to scamper
freely and drive unmolested by hostile bodies so that his numbers
should rebound — but only if Amare Stoudemire makes a full recovery.If
the Suns' championship hopes are rapidly dropping below the horizon,
Nash should still be able to reprise the effectiveness that won him
double-MVP honors. Jason Kidd (36): No longer able to
get to the hoop with the same ease as before, Kidd is still a dangerous
half-court presence. Getting into the paint is a rare occasion these
days, which means that his ability to drive and dish will be severely
curtailed. Also, without the quickness to zip his dribble through
traffic, his in-the-paint drop-off assists will also be few and far
between. But he can still read defenses, anticipate teammates moving
into open spaces, and facilitate a running game with accurate long
passes.Above all, Kidd has become a reliable 3-point shooter
through the years, and it's this improvement that's the real key to his
effectiveness when the Mavs are in the attack zone.The
diminishment of his speed and quickness is most evident, however, on
defense. No longer can he adequately defend virtually every opposing
point guard. In his defensive dotage, Kidd is still capable, however,
of playing lock-down defense on most of the league's shooting guards.Untouched
by his advancing years, though, is J-Kidd's razor-sharp competitive
edge. If most of his other skills of yesteryear are in decline, this
attitude is enough to be a huge plus for Dallas.    

Ray Allen (34): This guy can still play. Indeed, the only
sign of his advanced age is the increasingly prolonged dry spells he
has experienced in the last two seasons. Unfortunately, his latest
extended slump came during last season's playoffs. While this is
certainly not good news for the Celtics, the mitigating circumstance
was that Kevin Garnett's absence enabled defenses to focus more on
Allen. Also, Allen essentially petered out in the postseason
because he averaged 40.3 minutes per game during the regular season. To
keep him fresh, this total must be reduced to around 35 minutes per.
That's why it's imperative to avoid using him at the point guard slot. Marcus Camby (35):
His game is based almost entirely on length and quickness. But as the
years fade into memories, he's become increasingly slower off his feet.
While he remains an influential shot-changer and shot-blocker, his
swat-average was lower last season than it has been since the 2001-02
season. As a result, opponents are more eager to take the ball right at
him.When speed-finesse players lose even a half step, their
usefulness takes a sharp nosedive. And at 6-11 and a mere 235 pounds,
Camby lacks the bulk to compensate. Also, injuries have been a constant
bugaboo throughout his career and as he ages he will be more vulnerable
here.With Chris Kaman and blue-chip rookie Blake Griffin in town, Camby would contribute the most to the Clippers as a bench player.Michael Finley (36):
Richard Jefferson will inherit most of Finley's minutes. Yet Finley's
step-back jumper going left remains unstoppable and uncannily accurate.
Whereas he used to be an elite defender, those days are also long gone.
But since he's still an incredibly reliable clutch scorer, look for
Finley to become a situational shooter in the upcoming season.

Rasheed Wallace (35): Except for his rebounding, just
about every category in Rasheed's repertoire is in decline. Even so, he
remains a valuable asset mainly because of his defense. Also, Rasheed's
reluctance to venture into the low post in recent years and his
increased preference for shooting 3-balls have been instrumental in
extending his career. Ben Wallace (35): Big Ben has been
running on empty for several seasons. At this point, he could
conceivably play effective defense against low-post players for a pair
of six-minute rotations per game, not enough banging to warrant the big
bucks he's making. Getting old is a drag for everybody.
Reflexes become dulled. Staying healthy is an increasing problem.
Endurance is replaced by fatigue. For hoopers, jumpers fall
short, steps are lost, sneakers get heavy, the court seems longer, and
focus gets fuzzy. The most savvy of NBA veterans try to compensate by
exerting themselves only when their exertions will make a difference
(for example, keeping their legs as fresh as possible by avoiding
extraneous dunks), by flawlessly executing plays, closely following the
dictates of scouting reports, eating well, and getting more rest. And as demonstrated by the two Wallaces, the fact is that physical players generally wear out quicker than finesse players do.
