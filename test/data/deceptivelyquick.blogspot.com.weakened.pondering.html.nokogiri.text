The stats of LaMarcus Aldridge this season are nearly identical to his 2007-08 campaign. Some of the similarities are sort of startling: his field goal makes and attempts are the same to the tenth decimal place.But

we are interested in more than Aldridge's curious replication
tendencies. Despite a rabidly interested fan base he remains relatively
misunderstood in Rip City. Often labeled as soft because he has a
jumpshot, or derided as a mediocre rebounder even though he is among the League's elite in offensive boards, we at DeceptivelyQuick feel a call of duty to promote the truth.In December of 2007 I was all excited and linked to this videocollection
of highlights featuring LaMarcus throwing all kinds of sweet passes. I
was convinced that he possessed passing skills that were uncommon in a
power forward. For whatever reason we didn't seem to get to see these
particular talents displayed too often. He has never even averaged two
assists per game, which doesn't exactly help my case.Enter new basketball statistics. The people I steal from constantly, 82games.com, have created a different way to quantify passing skills. It starts with the classic assist to turnover ratio,
which is commonly accepted as an indicator of how effectively a player
can pass. Except that turnovers include all sorts of things besides
passing. For example, if a player is whistled for travelling or gets
the ball stolen while driving to the hoop a turnover would result. So
the 82games.com geniuses started tracking something called assist: bad pass turnover.
Yep, only turnovers resulting from passes are used, creating a stat
that we can safely say is more related to how effectively a player
passes the basketball.Where does LaMarcus Aldridge rank in this category? Are you ready to have your mind blown? Then click here. I'll let you take that in for a second.The
Blazers power forward has the highest assist to bad pass turnover rate
(7.1) in the entire NBA. This is freakish, and you need to appreciate
that. There are no other power forwards or centers in the top 10. There
are only three amongst the top 20. The four players immediately
following Aldridge are Chris Paul, Tony Parker, Tayshaun Prince, and
Jose Calderon.LaMarcus Aldridge: Respect the game.
