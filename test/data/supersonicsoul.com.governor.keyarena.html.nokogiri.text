Jim Brunner at the Seattle Times reports
that Gov. Gregoire does not expect to see SB 6116 to be passed during
the upcoming special session. According to Brunner, Gregoire said, "I
decided it wasn't a fight I was ready to fight for. I had other things
I had to fight for."This may seem to be a death knell for the
bill - and for the Sonics in the near future - but as Lyndon Johnson
famously said, "In politics you've got to learn that overnight chicken
s*** can turn to chicken salad."
