at a size deficit at power forward.

why not dedicate this summer to nothing but work at small forward? Why

            Yes,
some of the matchups will be frightening: Beasley vs. Paul Pierce,
Beasley vs. LeBron, Beasley vs. Andre Iguodala. But there also is a
school of thought that those guys with get their points, anyway.
                                                

            What
Beasley at small forward would do is force Dwyane Wade to cover
high-scoring shooting guards, no longer providing the option of
flip-flopping the assignments with a defensive-minded small forward.
                                                      

            Still,
in the Eastern Conference, where you play most opponents four times a
season, it would appear you could survive Beasley versus what would
have been this season's matchups of Marvin Williams, Luol Deng,
Tayshaun Prince, Richard Jefferson, Al Harrington, Bobby Simmons, Hedo
Turkoglu and Shawn Marion.
                                                

            Heck, in the Heat's final game of the season, when Beasley entered Sunday against the Hawks, he entered at small forward.
                                                    

            With
significant needs in other areas, with James Jones added as a bench
boost, it would be a shame for the Heat to go into 2009-10 without
knowing whether Beasley at small forward isn't a legitimate option. At
least take a look. It's worth finding out.

Beasley was, well, that he wasn't quite as Beast-ly as advertised.





 Whether

the assignment was Josh Smith or the other power forwards he covered,

when standing side by side, Michael didn't always exactly measure up.





 Using

whatever measurement you choose, the listed 6-10 out of Kansas State,

the 6-9 1/2 the Heat listed this season, the 6-8 1/4 he measured with

shoes at the pre-draft camp or the 6-7 without shoes, he usually played

at a size deficit at power forward.





 So

why not dedicate this summer to nothing but work at small forward? Why

not try to maximize this roster with Jermaine O'Neal, Udonis Haslem and

Beasley across the front line next season?

 

 Yes,

some of the matchups will be frightening: Beasley vs. Paul Pierce,

Beasley vs. LeBron, Beasley vs. Andre Iguodala. But there also is a

school of thought that those guys with get their points, anyway.
