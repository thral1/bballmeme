		The Risk of Trading a Top Three Pick (UPDATED) 

	Think Portland could've used either one of us? (NBAE via Getty Images) 

In his first draft as general manager of the Washington Wizards in
2004, Ernie Grunfeld selected Wisconsin point guard Devin Harris fifth
overall, paired him with Jerry Stackhouse and Christian Laettner, and
immediately shipped them to Dallas for Antawn Jamison. The move worked
out incredibly for both teams, with Harris and Stackhouse helping the
Mavericks reach the NBA Finals two years later and Jamison leading the
Wizards into their only four-year playoff run in the past 30 years. 

After a miserable 19-win campaign, the Wizards have dropped back
into the lottery and the franchise is assured a selection no less than
fifth in the NBA draft this June. The Wizards' lottery position will be
determined on May 19, and Grunfeld is again in a situation where he can
decide whether to keep the pick or trade the "asset" -- as he likes to
call it -- for a veteran player who can contribute right away. 

I've often assumed that Grunfeld would move the pick, since the team
needs to get older, not younger, if it's going to seriously contend.
But after further review, if the Wizards wind up with one of the top
three selections, the following list might caution Grunfeld from moving
it. Top three picks are usually franchise cornerstones or better yet,
keepers. Even if it isn't obvious at the time, sometimes it shakes out
that way (see: Billups, Chauncey). Giving up on those picks often comes
back to haunt teams.

If Washington ends up with four or five, Grunfeld should see if he
can find another Jamison or make a move like Boston President of
Basketball Operations Danny Ainge did two years, using fifth pick Jeff
Green to get Ray Allen. 

After looking back at the history of teams that have traded away top
three picks without ever having the player wear their uniform, the
success rate both long term and short term often has been horrendous.
The moments when teams trade top three picks for veterans and succeed
are rare. There are times when a team can land a Mitch Richmond (who
was acquired for Billy Owens), but mostly teams wind up with a Roy
Hinson (who was acquired for Brad Daugherty). 

In the lottery era, there have been 14 instances where teams dumped
top three picks and more often than not, that team was seeking a
do-over. We're going to look back at all of them, the three hits, the
eight misses, the two pushes and the one that is yet-to-be determined:  THE HITS I was pretty good before I came to Washington. (Photo by Rocky Widner/NBAE for Getty Images) 

The Los Angeles Clippers trade 1989 No. 2 overall pick Danny Ferry and Reggie Williams to Cleveland for Ron Harper, two first-round picks and a second-round pick:
Ferry initially ran to Italy rather than play for the Clippers. After
returning to the U.S., Ferry had a solid but unremarkable career. While
Harper suffered a career-altering knee injury, he also started on two
playoff teams with the Clippers. He later won five championships with
Chicago and the Lakers. 

The Sacramento Kings trade 1991 No. 3 overall pick Billy Owens to the Golden State Warriors in exchange for Mitch Richmond:
Great move because Owens had no desire to play in Sacramento and the
Kings were able swap a player who became a disappointing bust for a
three-time all-star guard.

The Clippers trade 2001 No. 2 overall pick Tyson Chandler and Brian Skinner to the Chicago Bulls for Elton Brand: One
of the few fantastic and lopsided deals in Clippers history, as Brand
made two all-star appearances and helped the franchise win a playoff
series in 2006. Chandler has recently become a reliable NBA contributor
-- in New Orleans. 

THE MISSESI know my career was cut short because of injury, but Roy Hinson!?! Seriously? (Tim DeFrisco/Getty Images) 

The Philadelphia 76ers trade 1986 No. 1 overall pick Brad Daugherty to Cleveland for Roy Hinson:
Daugherty became a five-time all-star and retired as the Cavaliers'
all-time leading scorer. Hinson gave the 76ers next to nothing and six
years later, franchise player Charles Barkley, frustrated because he
had no help, demanded a trade to Phoenix. 

The Clippers trade 1995 No. 2 overall pick Antonio McDyess and Randy Woods to the Denver Nuggets for Rodney Rogers and Brent Barry: McDyess
actually became an all-star and an Olympic gold medallist in his second
stint with Denver, but Rogers and Barry became journeymen role players.


Philadelphia trades 1997 No. 2 overall pick Keith Van Horn, Michael Cage, Lucious Harris and Don MacLean to the New Jersey Nets for Tim Thomas, Anthony Parker, Jim Jackson and Eric Montross: Van
Horn never became "The Next Larry Bird" but he had some promising
seasons with the Nets and was a starter on the 2002 NBA Finals team.
Thomas lasted 1 ½ seasons in Philadelphia and has been a classic
underachiever his entire career, showing the potential of his gifts
only when entering free agency. 

The Vancouver Grizzlies trade 1999 No. 2 overall pick Steve Francis to the Houston Rockets for Michael Dickerson, Othella Harrington, Antoine Carr, Brent Price, a first- and second-round pick:
This may have been the final deal that eventually led to the departure
of the basketball from western Canada. Francis forced a trade out of
Vancouver and went on to win co-rookie of the year and make three
all-star teams with Houston. The Grizzlies almost gathered an entire
team in exchange for Francis, but it wasn't a particularly good one.
And, while Dickerson put up decent numbers, this deal became a complete
and total flop when he was forced to retire from severe hamstring and
groin injuries in 2003 -- two years after the team moved to Memphis. 

 The exchange rate would've greatly diminished my hops. (Jed Jacobsohn/Allsport) 

The Atlanta Hawks send 2001 No. 3 overall pick Pau Gasol, Lorenzen Wright and Brevin Knight to Vancouver (Memphis) in exchange for Shareef Abdur-Rahim: Abdur-Rahim
became an all-star his first season in Atlanta but never reached the
playoffs in his home town. Gasol led the Grizzlies to the only three
postseason appearances in franchise history, while reaching the
all-star team in 2006. Gasol has since made another all-star team and
reached the NBA Finals with the Lakers. 

The Los Angeles Clippers trade the 2004 No. 2 overall pick to
the Charlotte Bobcats for picks No. 4 and No. 33 in the NBA draft. They
ended up dealing Emeka Okafor for Shaun Livingston and Lionel Chalmers:
Okafor has turned into one of the NBA's most serviceable big men,
averaging a double-double over his first five seasons in the league.
Livingston had an injury-plagued start, showed some promise, then his
career was eventually derailed by a serious knee injury. 

The Portland Trail Blazers trade the 2005 No. 3 overall pick to
the Utah Jazz for picks No. 6 and 27. The deal turned out to be swap of
Deron Williams for Martell Webster and Linas Kleiza:
This is in contention for worst trade of the decade. Portland had the
opportunity to draft Williams or Chris Paul, two potential Hall of Fame
point guards and instead selected a player who has yet to make an
impact and another who now resides in Denver. 

The Chicago Bulls trade 2006 No. 2 overall pick LaMarcus Aldridge to Portland for Tyrus Thomas and Viktor Khyrapa: Aldridge
isn't exactly a franchise player, but he has the low post game the
Bulls have been searching for for decades, and has shown all-star
potential. Thomas has been a frustratingly talented player with the
Bulls. 

THE PUSHES Yeah, Gheorghe. At least Orlando got some good years out of me. (AP Photo) 

The Philadelphia 76ers trade 1988 No. 3 overall pick Charles Smith to the Los Angeles Clippers for Hersey Hawkins and a first-round pick:
Smith was among the Clippers' top scorers and rebounders, but had a
relatively uneventful four-year stint with the team. Hawkins made the
all-star team in 1991 before getting traded to Charlotte in 1993.

The Orlando Magic trades 1993 No. 1 overall pick Chris Webber to Golden State for No. 3 overall pick Anfernee Hardaway and three future first round draft picks:
Since this trade involved two top three picks, this was tougher to
determine. Webber played only one season with the Warriors, which made
this a terrible deal for Golden State -- especially when the Warriors
wound up trading Webber to Washington for Tom Gugliotta and some draft
picks. But it was an awesome trade for Orlando, since Hardaway helped
the Magic reach the NBA Finals in 1995 and the conference finals in
1996, when he also won an Olympic gold medal. 

THE YET-TO-BE-DETERMINED You might regret this, Minnesota. (NBAE/Getty Images) 

The Minnesota Timberwolves trade No. 3 overall pick O.J. Mayo, Antoine Walker, Marko Jaric and Greg Buckner to the Memphis Grizzlies for Kevin Love, Mike Miller, Brian Cardinal and Jason Collins:
It's too early to call this trade a bust for Minnesota, but O.J. Mayo
has already shown the potential to be a superstar in the league, while
Love had a decent rookie campaign. With just one year to judge, this
one is still up for debate.

				I
appreciate the research Lee put into the article, but I don't agree
with the conclusion. This is a 2 player draft. Griffin and Rubio are
potential superstars. Griffin clearly shouldn't be traded. Rubio should
only be traded for somebody like Bosh who is also a superstar. 

But if we land the #3 pick, then trade options should definitely be

men like Thabeet and Hill. I don't think Thabeet is any better of a
prospect than McGee, and even if he is, he won't usurp Haywood's role
for at least 4-5 years, so why bother? Likewise, Hill doesn't look much
better than Blatche and he's not taking Jamison's spot anytime soon. 

So as far as players that can help us in this draft, we're looking
at guys like Harden, Evans, Curry, and Henderson. I think any of those
guys could compete with Stevenson, Young and Crittenton for guard
minutes, but none of them are huge upgrades. Furthermore, I think most
of those guys would be available in the 7-10 range, there is no need to

So, assuming we can't use our #3 pick as incentive to trade for a

a few slots, dump Stevenson's contract, and draft
Curry/Henderson/Evans/Harden. A trade with Toronto would work out
perfect. They have the #9 pick and cap room. They need a center like
Thabeet and would be willing to absorb one of our bad contracts to get
him. Unloading Stevenson (and paying a #9 pick salary instead of a #3
pick salary) would save Abe about $20M in salary and luxtax fees over
the next two years while still landing us a rookie that can help us.

The Risk of Trading a Top Three Pick (UPDATED)

In his first draft as general manager of the Washington Wizards in

After a miserable 19-win campaign, the Wizards have dropped back

determined on May 19, and Grunfeld is again in a situation where he can

decide whether to keep the pick or trade the "asset" -- as he likes to

call it -- for a veteran player who can contribute right away. 



I've often assumed that Grunfeld would move the pick, since the team

needs to get older, not younger, if it's going to seriously contend.

But after further review, if the Wizards wind up with one of the top

three selections, the following list might caution Grunfeld from moving

it. Top three picks are usually franchise cornerstones or better yet,

keepers. Even if it isn't obvious at the time, sometimes it shakes out

back to haunt teams.

In the lottery era, there have been 14 instances where teams dumped

do-over. We're going to look back at all of them, the three hits, the

eight misses, the two pushes and the one that is yet-to-be determined:  THE HITS I was pretty good before I came to Washington. (Photo by Rocky Widner/NBAE for Getty Images)

a few slots, dump Stevenson's contract, and draft

Curry/Henderson/Evans/Harden. A trade with Toronto would work out

perfect. They have the #9 pick and cap room. They need a center like

Thabeet and would be willing to absorb one of our bad contracts to get

him. Unloading Stevenson (and paying a #9 pick salary instead of a #3

pick salary) would save Abe about $20M in salary and luxtax fees over

the next two years while still landing us a rookie that can help us.

		<h3>The Risk of Trading a Top Three Pick (UPDATED)</h3> 

	<div class="imgcenter"><img src="voices.washingtonpost.com_top_three_pick_files/paulwilliams504.jpg" border="0" height="228" align="bottom" /><br /><span class="blog_caption">Think Portland could've used either one of us? (NBAE via Getty Images) <span></span></span></div>

<p><br />In his first draft as general manager of the Washington Wizards in
2004, Ernie Grunfeld selected Wisconsin point guard Devin Harris fifth
overall, paired him with Jerry Stackhouse and Christian Laettner, and
immediately shipped them to Dallas for Antawn Jamison. The move worked
out incredibly for both teams, with Harris and Stackhouse helping the
Mavericks reach the NBA Finals two years later and Jamison leading the
Wizards into their only four-year playoff run in the past 30 years. </p>

<p>After a miserable 19-win campaign, the Wizards have dropped back
into the lottery and the franchise is assured a selection no less than
fifth in the NBA draft this June. The Wizards' lottery position will be
determined on May 19, and Grunfeld is again in a situation where he can
decide whether to keep the pick or trade the "asset" -- as he likes to
call it -- for a veteran player who can contribute right away. </p>

<p>I've often assumed that Grunfeld would move the pick, since the team
needs to get older, not younger, if it's going to seriously contend.
But after further review, if the Wizards wind up with one of the top
three selections, the following list might caution Grunfeld from moving
it. Top three picks are usually franchise cornerstones or better yet,
keepers. Even if it isn't obvious at the time, sometimes it shakes out
that way (see: Billups, Chauncey). Giving up on those picks often comes
back to haunt teams.</p>

<p>If Washington ends up with four or five, Grunfeld should see if he
can find another Jamison or make a move like Boston President of
Basketball Operations Danny Ainge did two years, using fifth pick Jeff
Green to get Ray Allen. </p>

<p>After looking back at the history of teams that have traded away top
three picks without ever having the player wear their uniform, the
success rate both long term and short term often has been horrendous.
The moments when teams trade top three picks for veterans and succeed
are rare. There are times when a team can land a Mitch Richmond (who
was acquired for Billy Owens), but mostly teams wind up with a Roy
Hinson (who was acquired for Brad Daugherty). </p>

<p>In the lottery era, there have been 14 instances where teams dumped
top three picks and more often than not, that team was seeking a
do-over. We're going to look back at all of them, the three hits, the
eight misses, the two pushes and the one that is yet-to-be determined:</p> <a id="more"></a> <p><strong>THE HITS</strong><br /></p><div class="imgright"><img src="voices.washingtonpost.com_top_three_pick_files/richmond504.jpg" border="0" height="247" align="bottom" /><br /><span class="blog_caption"> I was pretty good before I came to Washington. (Photo by Rocky Widner/NBAE for Getty Images) <span></span></span></div><p></p>

<p><em>The Los Angeles Clippers trade 1989 No. 2 overall pick <strong>Danny Ferry</strong> and Reggie Williams to Cleveland for <strong>Ron Harper</strong>, two first-round picks and a second-round pick</em>:
Ferry initially ran to Italy rather than play for the Clippers. After
returning to the U.S., Ferry had a solid but unremarkable career. While
Harper suffered a career-altering knee injury, he also started on two
playoff teams with the Clippers. He later won five championships with
Chicago and the Lakers. </p>

<p><em>The Sacramento Kings trade 1991 No. 3 overall pick <strong>Billy Owens </strong>to the Golden State Warriors in exchange for <strong>Mitch Richmond</strong>:</em>
Great move because Owens had no desire to play in Sacramento and the
Kings were able swap a player who became a disappointing bust for a
three-time all-star guard.</p>

<p><em>The Clippers trade 2001 No. 2 overall pick <strong>Tyson Chandler </strong>and Brian Skinner to the Chicago Bulls for <strong>Elton Brand</strong>: </em>One
of the few fantastic and lopsided deals in Clippers history, as Brand
made two all-star appearances and helped the franchise win a playoff
series in 2006. Chandler has recently become a reliable NBA contributor
-- in New Orleans. </p>

<p><strong>THE MISSES</strong><br /></p><div class="imgright"><img src="voices.washingtonpost.com_top_three_pick_files/daugherty504.png" border="0" height="285" align="bottom" /><br /><span class="blog_caption">I know my career was cut short because of injury, but Roy Hinson!?! Seriously? (Tim DeFrisco/Getty Images) <span></span></span></div><p></p>

<p><em>The Philadelphia 76ers trade 1986 No. 1 overall pick <strong>Brad Daugherty </strong>to Cleveland for <strong>Roy Hinson</strong>:</em>
Daugherty became a five-time all-star and retired as the Cavaliers'
all-time leading scorer. Hinson gave the 76ers next to nothing and six
years later, franchise player Charles Barkley, frustrated because he
had no help, demanded a trade to Phoenix. </p>

<p><em>The Clippers trade 1995 No. 2 overall pick <strong>Antonio McDyess</strong> and Randy Woods to the Denver Nuggets for <strong>Rodney Rogers</strong> and <strong>Brent Barry</strong>: </em>McDyess
actually became an all-star and an Olympic gold medallist in his second
stint with Denver, but Rogers and Barry became journeymen role players.
</p>

<p><em>Philadelphia trades 1997 No. 2 overall pick <strong>Keith Van Horn</strong>, Michael Cage, Lucious Harris and Don MacLean to the New Jersey Nets for<strong> Tim Thomas</strong>, Anthony Parker, Jim Jackson and Eric Montross: </em>Van
Horn never became "The Next Larry Bird" but he had some promising
seasons with the Nets and was a starter on the 2002 NBA Finals team.
Thomas lasted 1 ½ seasons in Philadelphia and has been a classic
underachiever his entire career, showing the potential of his gifts
only when entering free agency. </p>

<p><em>The Vancouver Grizzlies trade 1999 No. 2 overall pick <strong>Steve Francis </strong>to the Houston Rockets for <strong>Michael Dickerson</strong>, Othella Harrington, Antoine Carr, Brent Price, a first- and second-round pick:</em>
This may have been the final deal that eventually led to the departure
of the basketball from western Canada. Francis forced a trade out of
Vancouver and went on to win co-rookie of the year and make three
all-star teams with Houston. The Grizzlies almost gathered an entire
team in exchange for Francis, but it wasn't a particularly good one.
And, while Dickerson put up decent numbers, this deal became a complete
and total flop when he was forced to retire from severe hamstring and
groin injuries in 2003 -- two years after the team moved to Memphis. </p>

<div class="imgright"><img src="voices.washingtonpost.com_top_three_pick_files/francis505.jpg" border="0" height="342" align="bottom" /><br /><span class="blog_caption"> The exchange rate would've greatly diminished my hops. (Jed Jacobsohn/Allsport) <span></span></span></div>

<p><em>The Atlanta Hawks send 2001 No. 3 overall pick <strong>Pau Gasol</strong>, Lorenzen Wright and Brevin Knight to Vancouver (Memphis) in exchange for <strong>Shareef Abdur-Rahim</strong>: </em>Abdur-Rahim
became an all-star his first season in Atlanta but never reached the
playoffs in his home town. Gasol led the Grizzlies to the only three
postseason appearances in franchise history, while reaching the
all-star team in 2006. Gasol has since made another all-star team and
reached the NBA Finals with the Lakers. </p>

<p><em>The Los Angeles Clippers trade the 2004 No. 2 overall pick to
the Charlotte Bobcats for picks No. 4 and No. 33 in the NBA draft. They
ended up dealing <strong>Emeka Okafor</strong> for <strong>Shaun Livingston </strong>and Lionel Chalmers:</em>
Okafor has turned into one of the NBA's most serviceable big men,
averaging a double-double over his first five seasons in the league.
Livingston had an injury-plagued start, showed some promise, then his
career was eventually derailed by a serious knee injury. </p>

<p><em>The Portland Trail Blazers trade the 2005 No. 3 overall pick to
the Utah Jazz for picks No. 6 and 27. The deal turned out to be swap of
<strong>Deron Williams </strong>for <strong>Martell Webster</strong> and <strong>Linas Kleiza</strong></em>:
This is in contention for worst trade of the decade. Portland had the
opportunity to draft Williams or Chris Paul, two potential Hall of Fame
point guards and instead selected a player who has yet to make an
impact and another who now resides in Denver. </p>

<p><em>The Chicago Bulls trade 2006 No. 2 overall pick <strong>LaMarcus Aldridge </strong>to Portland for <strong>Tyrus Thomas </strong>and <strong>Viktor Khyrapa</strong>: </em>Aldridge
isn't exactly a franchise player, but he has the low post game the
Bulls have been searching for for decades, and has shown all-star
potential. Thomas has been a frustratingly talented player with the
Bulls. </p>

<p><br /><strong>THE PUSHES</strong><br /></p><div class="imgright"><img src="voices.washingtonpost.com_top_three_pick_files/penny504.jpg" border="0" height="354" align="bottom" /><br /><span class="blog_caption"> Yeah, Gheorghe. At least Orlando got some good years out of me. (AP Photo) <span></span></span></div><p></p>

<p><em>The Philadelphia 76ers trade 1988 No. 3 overall pick <strong>Charles Smith</strong> to the Los Angeles Clippers for <strong>Hersey Hawkins</strong> and a first-round pick:</em>
Smith was among the Clippers' top scorers and rebounders, but had a
relatively uneventful four-year stint with the team. Hawkins made the
all-star team in 1991 before getting traded to Charlotte in 1993.</p>

<p><em>The Orlando Magic trades 1993 No. 1 overall pick <strong>Chris Webber</strong> to Golden State for No. 3 overall pick <strong>Anfernee Hardaway</strong> and three future first round draft picks</em>:
Since this trade involved two top three picks, this was tougher to
determine. Webber played only one season with the Warriors, which made
this a terrible deal for Golden State -- especially when the Warriors
wound up trading Webber to Washington for Tom Gugliotta and some draft
picks. But it was an awesome trade for Orlando, since Hardaway helped
the Magic reach the NBA Finals in 1995 and the conference finals in
1996, when he also won an Olympic gold medal. </p>

<p><strong>THE YET-TO-BE-DETERMINED</strong><br /></p><div class="imgright"><img src="voices.washingtonpost.com_top_three_pick_files/mayo504.jpg" border="0" height="255" align="bottom" /><br /><span class="blog_caption"> You might regret this, Minnesota. (NBAE/Getty Images) <span></span></span></div><p></p>

<p><em>The Minnesota Timberwolves trade No. 3 overall pick <strong>O.J. Mayo</strong>, Antoine Walker, Marko Jaric and Greg Buckner to the Memphis Grizzlies for <strong>Kevin Love</strong>, Mike Miller, Brian Cardinal and Jason Collins:</em>
It's too early to call this trade a bust for Minnesota, but O.J. Mayo
has already shown the potential to be a superstar in the league, while
Love had a decent rookie campaign. With just one year to judge, this
one is still up for debate. </p>

				<p>I
appreciate the research Lee put into the article, but I don't agree
with the conclusion. This is a 2 player draft. Griffin and Rubio are
potential superstars. Griffin clearly shouldn't be traded. Rubio should
only be traded for somebody like Bosh who is also a superstar. </p>

<p>But if we land the #3 pick, then trade options should definitely be
on the table. The best players available at #3 are raw, redundant big
men like Thabeet and Hill. I don't think Thabeet is any better of a
prospect than McGee, and even if he is, he won't usurp Haywood's role
for at least 4-5 years, so why bother? Likewise, Hill doesn't look much
better than Blatche and he's not taking Jamison's spot anytime soon. </p>

<p>So as far as players that can help us in this draft, we're looking
at guys like Harden, Evans, Curry, and Henderson. I think any of those
guys could compete with Stevenson, Young and Crittenton for guard
minutes, but none of them are huge upgrades. Furthermore, I think most
of those guys would be available in the 7-10 range, there is no need to
expend a #3 pick on them.</p>

<p>So, assuming we can't use our #3 pick as incentive to trade for a
star-caliber veteran, then the next best option would be to trade down
a few slots, dump Stevenson's contract, and draft
Curry/Henderson/Evans/Harden. A trade with Toronto would work out
perfect. They have the #9 pick and cap room. They need a center like
Thabeet and would be willing to absorb one of our bad contracts to get
him. Unloading Stevenson (and paying a #9 pick salary instead of a #3
pick salary) would save Abe about $20M in salary and luxtax fees over
the next two years while still landing us a rookie that can help us.</p>
