Apparently it was, and more specifically, it was a celebration, not a taunt.<br /><br />The technical was called after he celebrated a made basket. Cleveland\'s Anderson Varejao grabbed Howard around the shoulders on a hard foul and Superman pumped his fists in Varejao\'s direction after putting the ball in the hoop.<br /><br />""I was just playing with emotion,"" Dwight said Tuesday night after the win. ""I wasn\'t taunting Varejao or anything.

Even though Howard&#39;s claims that he should be seeing more shots weren&#39;t rooted in any empirical truth, his misperceptions could potentially be beneficial. Given his muscle and athleticism, the Magic <em>should</em> prosper from the ball being in Howard&#39;s hands.

Some of that can be chalked up Orlando&#39;s reliance on the three-ball, which was itself a response to Cleveland&#39;s clogging the middle against Howard. In the final six minutes of regulation, Howard manages only one chance from the field, when he gets a pass deep in the post from Hedo Turkoglu just inside of the 2:00 mark of the fourth quarter. Howard is immediately hacked by Anderson Varejao. Although his presence is helping Orlando&#39;s shooters, Howard is essentially an offensive decoy in the second half.&nbsp;</p> <p>The Magic&#39;s pick-and-roll game gets lost at times in their prolific three-point attack, but they start the overtime period with a high screen/roll with Howard and Turkoglu. As Turkoglu turns the corner to his left, Howard dives through the lane, where all three Cleveland guards collapse on him. Varejao ultimately picks Turkoglu&#39;s pocket, which leads to a Cleveland break and a couple of free throws for Boobie Gibson. It&#39;s an inauspicious start to overtime for the Magic.&nbsp;</p> <p>When Orlando brings the ball up the next trip down, it appears as if the Magic aren&#39;t going to use Howard in the offense any differently than they did in the second half. Off the initial pick-and-roll, Howard draws Mo Wiliams on the rotation in the paint, but Rafer Alston doesn&#39;t look at Howard. By the time he does, Varejao has recovered and replaces Williams as the post defender on Howard, and the mismatch is lost.&nbsp;</p> <p>As Alston passes the ball off the Turkoglu on the left wing, Howard keeps fighting with Varejao for position on the left block. Sometimes, Howard can get dejected when he&#39;s ignored on the initial action. He won&#39;t quit working, but there&#39;s a difference between setting up in the post and bruising for every last inch inside. On this possession, Howard is doing the latter. Turkoglu recognizes it, and promptly feeds Howard on the left block. Howard does something here he doesn&#39;t frequently do -- he trusts his feet. Pounding the ball into the court, Howard backs Varejao in with his left shoulder. He collects the ball confidently, then pivots on his right foot to spin baseline. That&#39;s all he needs to get to the rim for the slam. Normally when Howard gets the ball at this spot in this situation, he&#39;s hesitant to change direction and we see him try to sweep across the lane and fling a running hook shot at the basket. Not this time.</p> <p>What happens the next trip down when Alston is again blitzed on the pick-and-roll? He instantly looks for Howard on the dive. Delonte West has a nice defensive game, but he commits a fatal error here by leaving Howard too early. Instead of waiting another second or two for Varejao to recover, West runs out on Turkoglu, which leaves Howard wide open underneath. Perhaps it&#39;s reading too much into nothing more than a mental error, but what does West&#39;s decision to worry more about Turkoglu than Howard say about Orlando&#39;s late-game offense?</p> <p>Cleveland&#39;s had enough. The last two possessions have prompted them to make a defensive adjustment to account for Howard. When the high screen/roll comes this time around, Varejao drops back into the paint. The Magic run a mirror image of the first Howard set, this time from the right side. Pietrus gets the entry pass into Howard. When Varejao gambles by trying to get in front of the pass, that&#39;s all the room Howard needs to build the head of steam that will power him to the rim with a left-handed drive. After Howard drops the ball through the hoop, an irate LeBron James whips his right arm in disgust at Varejao and, according to Doug Collins, yells to his teammate, &quot;Foul him!&quot;</p> <p>That&#39;s exactly what Ben Wallace does with 21 seconds to go and the Magic leading by two. The most common reason attributed to Orlando&#39;s reluctance to feed Howard down the stretch in close games is his inability to convert at the line. For the fourth consecutive season, Howard drained fewer than 60 percent of his free throw attempts. Howard is 8-14 in Game 4 before he steps up to the line for two of the bigger attempts of his career. Alhough Howard&#39;s three dunks earlier in the period were more momentous, and his tip-in off a Turkoglu miss two possessions earlier gave the Magic a commanding six-point lead with just over a minute remaining, it&#39;s these pair of free throws that probably offer Orlando fans the most comfort. Both shots fall through without grazing the rim.&nbsp;</p> <p>The broad narrative of Game 4 will be about Dwight Howard&#39;s arrival as a closer, the night he lorded his physical gifts over everyone on the court when it mattered the most. Will it also be the point on the chronological axis when getting the ball to Dwight Howard started to matter? Maybe, maybe not. That&#39;s a trend that should play out for at least a full season before it&#39;s declared meaningful, but you think Dwight Howard cares about sample sizes?&nbsp;</p>",21,0.0,19,"Lebron James Dwight Howard ",0

What Dwight did Tuesday is what superstars do: he took over the game when it mattered most. He scored the first three buckets in OT on dunks.

Yes, he put 44 points next to his name, but he&#39;d be the first to confess it was not a great game. Think about the score: Orlando 116, Cavs 114.

But something funny has happened in this series: The Nuggets are no longer in awe of the venue or the players. Los Angeles now is just another town. The Staples Center is just another arena. The Lakers have become just another team. The Nuggets won Game 2 in Los Angeles. It was their first postseason win over the Lakers in 11 games, which spanned 24 years.

In Game 4, the Nuggets played like a team that could not lose; the Lakers played like a team that, well, you know, could pretty much go either way with it, whatever.

It cannot be granted through the words of enamored fans, pundits and advertisers. It cannot be guaranteed by potential and deeds that have been speculated about, but not yet performed. Greatness, the kind that Michael Jordan, Magic Johnson and Larry Bird achieved, must be earned through actual accomplishments, not words or glitzy commercials. James faces such a task, after last night&#39;s 116-114 overtime loss in Game 4 of the Eastern Conference final. His Cleveland Cavaliers are now down, 3-1, in the best-of-seven series to the Orlando Magic, even though he scored 44 points last night, including hitting two free throws to send the game into overtime. It is now time for James to take a huge step toward validation, or he faces serious questions about his much-hyped legend.

At 6-foot-10 and 220 pounds, he has long fancied himself as a supersized playmaker -- not unlike his favorite player, Scottie Pippen. That is, a player who creates shots for himself and teammates, rebounds, handles the ball, makes decisions and superbly enters the ball into the post. &#39;The thing that separates Hedo right now is his passing, his creativity,&#39; said Geoff Petrie, the Kings basketball president. &#39;To have a guy that size who can make good decisions, penetrate and score himself, that&#39;s a tough matchup for anybody.&#39; ... Turkoglu&#39;s demeanor has always been deceiving. His deep-set eyes, half-smiles and slow speaking manner disguise a quiet confidence and competitiveness, and he plays at a pace and rhythm all his own. With long, graceful strides, he directs the fast break without ever appearing to rush. Because of his height and instincts, he effortlessly tosses lobs over defenders for rim-rattling dunks by Dwight Howard and Rashard Lewis. And for final possessions, the ball is in his hands.

It might be a flawed assumption, but without it this column doesn&#39;t work. Would you like the new owner of the Bobcats to be Michael Jordan, the team&#39;s managing member of basketball operations? I would not. Nothing Michael has accomplished indicates he is capable of running a major-league franchise. The Bobcats (the organization, not the team) have been so abysmal for so many years that they need to start over. That&#39;s why I hope the sale of the team is not pretend. I hope Michael and his supposed super secret investment partners are not sitting in the shadows, waiting to see how low owner Bob Johnson will go before they pounce. ... Don&#39;t we know by now that possessing a big name is not enough? Ask Dale Earnhardt Jr. For three years, Michael has been the franchise&#39;s No.2 man. After a horrid start (he drafted Adam Morrison), he has made some nice basketball moves or, at least, granted his coach permission to make them. He gets credit either way. But what else has Michael accomplished? Here he is, the biggest name in Charlotte sports.

The year before, when Bosh missed 15 games due to injury, he was 26th. Both times, coincidentally, he finished one spot ahead of Atlanta&#39;s Joe Johnson, a miscast No. 1 if there ever was one. The best-case scenario is that there is a leap left in Bosh, or that he can be a Garnett-like centrepiece on a team with perimeter finishers. It&#39;s not clear that either is a possibility. Regardless, Bosh will command a maximum contract as a free agent next summer -- beginning at 30% of the salary cap, whatever it is, which makes it harder to build one hell of an ensemble -- and will be forcefully pursued by more than one other team, including at least one with more immediate championship ambitions than Toronto. The big question being asked is whether the Raptors can resign their franchise player. But that is not the only question. The other one is this: even if they can re-sign Bosh -- the team&#39;s best player, a four-time all-star, a good citizen and teammate and employee -- should they?&quot;</li> 	<li><a href=""http://www.jsonline.com/sports/bucks/46136062.html"" target=""new"">Tom Enlund of the Journal Sentinel:</a> &quot;Making sound financial decisions will be extremely high on the Milwaukee Bucks&#39; priority list as they move forward into the summer and attempt to improve their roster and salary structure. In fact, according to general manager John Hammond, the team will be making decisions in the weeks and months ahead based as much on financial considerations as on basketball considerations. &#39;Right now, having (financial) discipline is the best thing for us,&#39; said Hammond. Financial discipline. Those will be words to live by for the Bucks as they move toward the June 25 draft, consider possible trades and enter the free-agent signing period in July. The team&#39;s financial discipline will affect the future and, more specifically, restricted free agents Charlie Villanueva and Ramon Sessions, and possibly European player Ersan Ilyasova. It will affect whom the Bucks select in the draft and whether they will be able to sign a free agent this summer, which right now appears highly unlikely. The upside, though, is that if the Bucks are able to maintain that discipline now, as difficult as it might be, it will afford them the flexibility in a year or two to make some major moves and deal from a position of power rather than with their backs against the wall.&quot;</li> </ul>",6,0.0,19,"Kobe Bryant Lebron James Carmelo Anthony Chris Bosh Joe Johnson Dwight Howard ",0

TrueHoop reader <a href=""http://go2page3.blogspot.com/"" target=""_blank"">Steven</a> did the hard work of looking up the times of all of Howard&#39;s technicals, and I just watched them all on Synergy Sports. Here is a rundown:</p> <ul> 	<li><strong>April 22, Game 2 vs. Sixers, 4:33 Third Quarter: Clearly a Technical</strong><br /> Howard get the ball in the post against Theo Ratliff. Ratliff crumples to the floor, almost certainly flopping, but gets the call. In anger, Howard fires the ball at the photographers on press row. No, he wasn&#39;t passing it to the referee. He was angry, and this was a technical that would have been called on anyone.</li> 	<li><strong>April 28, Game 5 vs. Sixers, 9:15 First Quarter: Double Punishment</strong><br /> One of the scariest plays of the playoffs, where Howard nails Samuel Dalembert with a hard elbow to the head. The rules call for an automatic ejection.</li> 	<li>Instead he got a technical from the referee and a subsequent one-game suspension from the league office. The irony is that if he had been ejected he would have missed part of one game. By getting the seemingly milder technical, this play could contribute to Howard missing two. Another point: He served his time for this crime already, right? Seems odd to have this technical still count. Hasn&#39;t the NBA essentially decided that there was contact, for which the punishment was a suspension. And doesn&#39;t that mean the technical was a bad call? Odd to have both punishments in effect. You could make the case that technical should still be rescinded.</li> 	<li><strong>May 14, Game 6 vs. Celtics 7:46 First Quarter: Taunting Scalabrine</strong><br /> Somehow Dwight Howard is guarded in the post by Brian Scalabrine, who flops. After scoring, Howard drops the ball onto a fallen Scalabrine. Perhaps he says something, too. This is the kind of thing that has often been considered taunting and punished with a technical.</li> 	<li><strong>May 20, Game 1 vs. Cavaliers, 9:42 Third Quarter: Heated at the Referee</strong><br /> LeBron James, as a help defender, blocks a Howard shot at the rim. Very hard to tell if there was contact or not, but Howard certainly thought there was, and as he turned to get back on defense, he threw an angry &quot;air punch&quot; in the direction of the nearest referee, while screaming something or other. It&#39;s something you see in every NBA game, and often it&#39;s not punished with a technical, but I&#39;d want to know what he said before saying this was a bad call. Another case where it might be nice to hear the referees&#39; side of the story.</li> 	<li><strong>May 24, Game 3 vs. Cavaliers, 2:49 Third Quarter: A Mystery</strong><br /> Howard was battling with Ben Wallace in the lane, and was called for a foul. Wallace went flying out of bounds on the play, either because Howard shoved him, or because he acted like Howard shoved him. After the play, there&#39;s a timeout, and nine players head to the huddle, but Howard stays behind, holding the ball above his head on the baseline, distraught at the call. Here&#39;s where my video lets me down, because I can&#39;t see what happens next, but I do know he was whistled for a technical immediately afterwards.</li> </ul> <p>Put it all together, and what do you get? You get extremely important calls -- owing to their potential contribution to suspensions -- that are a little hard to understand. Technicals are rescinded by the League at a high rate, which gives the impression that referees have tendencies to be overly aggressive handing them out.</p> <p>I understand the the league&#39;s top priority is eliminating bench-clearing brawls, and the seeds of those brawls are in some of the kinds of things that Dwight Howard does, like elbowing Samuel Dalembert, or dropping a ball on a fallen Brian Scalabrine.</p> <p>But as for a heated moment of screaming at a referee, or being emphatic after a big made bucket ... I&#39;d hate for a tremendous series to be decided by something like that. (Playing without Superman in the Sixer series, the Magic romped. So maybe the prospect of a suspension shouldn&#39;t be quite as dire as it seems to Orlando. But you&#39;d hate to count on it.)</p> <p>I&#39;m also, now, for the first time, baffled that his swung elbow could be punished by <em>both</em> a suspension and a technical. It seems that couldn&#39;t possibly be proper. The suspension was a bigger penalty -- an entire game vs. a partial one -- than what the rule book calls for. A technical in addition seems to be going well beyond the rulebook.</p> <p>And if technicals are going to be so important in the playoffs, shouldn&#39;t fans and players have a clear understanding of what is and what isn&#39;t a technical? In the regular season, I really don&#39;t care. But in the playoffs, with so much on the line, I find myself hungry for real explanations of what happened in each case. I also can&#39;t help but wonder why all this stuff is so secret. I don&#39;t know why, but am certainly aware that the secrecy lets the league office do whatever it wants in such situations, without possibility for second-guessing. In an age when everything is available on internet video, and evidence is available to support anything fair and true, secrecy just seems weirder and weirder by the year.</p>",42,0.0,19,"Lebron James Dwight Howard ",0

Instead, to their credit, the Cavs deployed a kind of ferocious basketball intelligence that seemed to consciously target the lethargy countenanced by other squads. More than any team I can remember, Cleveland was one which generated its own momentum, often through excelling, if that&#39;s the right word, at seemingly innocuous NBA mechanics. Slapping at loose balls; getting hands in as men drove by; dramatically throwing up their arms to sway referee impressions about loose balls--on most nights, Cleveland was this boiling stew of total basketball focus which most teams couldn&#39;t match. The Cavaliers took such tremendous pride in doing small things so attentively and in such animated fashion that it suggested a few things: they felt the need to be smarter than the other team in order to win; they derived purpose from being constructively irritating; they didn&#39;t feel that the normal tactics and rhythms of NBA basketball were terms under which the could win, so they fashioned a somewhat radical approach in demeanor and concentration. That&#39;s being an underdog.  What I&#39;ve described sounds admirable, perhaps even romantic, doesn&#39;t it? Who couldn&#39;t love this team which has innovated at the margins? It might even be genius, of sorts: dispensing with the flashy but ultimately fruitless total assaults on basketball convention, Cleveland has still subtly played by new rules. This is a team of high-achieving underdogs who have taken that desperate style and made it a goliath game; their aspirational, dire effort is that expected of overmatched opponents. It has stylized a collection of minute changes to create a distinct basketball method. That should be cool, right? Yes, it should. But somehow, with these players, it isn&#39;t.&quot;</li> 	<li><a href=""http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/playoffs/2009/columns/story?page=ScoutingNuggetsLakers5"" target=""_blank"">Mike Moreau on the Lakers</a>: &quot;They are in a fight, and even though the rounds may be even on the scorecard, they are taking many more punches than they are giving.

His positions are too calculated. I believe that is quietly driving people to LeBron James as the answer. We can see James trying to figure it out in front of us, even when it&#39;s corny, it&#39;s authentically corny.</p> <p>Bryant is like a PR machine, furiosly restoring his pre-Colorado reputation.

If Bynum was as inspired as Anderson Varejao, the Lakers would already be in the Finals.</p> <p>But the truth is, Bryant isn&#39;t that guy, and increasingly I am less inspired to watch.</p> <p>Kobe&#39;s got the focus of a ninja and the heart of an assassin.

Some notes on the big game at Staples Center:<br /> <ul> 	<li>The Lakers had various runs -- a 10-1 run early in the game, a 7-0 run in the middle of the third. But the Nuggets more than responded, and led most of the night. The Lakers needed spectacular plays just to keep it close ... until the beginning of the fourth quarter. That 11-0 Laker run was different from the others. That&#39;s when the Lakers played their best, but it&#39;s also when the Nuggets played their worst. Two great looks for Kenyon Martin were both botched. Chauncey Billups launched a 27-foot 3-pointer with 13 seconds on the shot clock. Nene got an offensive foul and a technical and had to leave the game for a few minutes. Credit the Nuggets with recovering their poise down the stretch, but the crowd was into it, the Lakers were fired up, and the damage was done.</li> 	<li>Lamar Odom approached the free throw line, after getting fouled making a mean dunk. But his face was sweaty. So he did what anyone would do, he wiped his face ... on his <em>shorts</em>. Seriously. Bent over in half and stuck his face down by his knees. Flexible, open-minded dude. (And what&#39;s wrong with using the shirt?)<br /> </li> 	<li>Kobe Bryant said he made a conscious effort to be a decoy. I&#39;d be very interested in how that idea came about. Did Bryant tell anyone about it? Did the coaching staff gameplan for it? Or was it a game-time thing? Now that it has worked, it puts Denver in a guessing game for Game 5. L.A. might do it again. But I wouldn&#39;t bet on it.</li> 	<li>Carmelo Anthony gave Kobe Bryant a bona fide shot to the face, but it was called a regular foul. That was one of several plays that made you think &quot;<em>they&#39;re letting them play</em>.&quot; The exception: Nene&#39;s incredibly feeble sixth foul.</li> 	<li>At one point, Odom bent over and the camera angle caught the profile of his back, with its protruding hunch -- a swollen bruise, wrapped in protective covering. It&#39;s big. I can only imagine how painful that must be.</li> 	<li>Phil Jackson deserves all kinds of credit for a career of experimenting. Think about Shannon Brown. Since entering the league in 2006, he has started just nine games, and played a total of about 900 minutes. He couldn&#39;t get off Mike Brown&#39;s bench in Cleveland. Ditto Scott Skiles&#39; in Chicago, and Larry Brown&#39;s in Charlotte. But in Game 5 of the Western Conference Finals, Brpwn plays 14 big minutes of the second half, and delivers a huge dunk and lots of useful energy. During Brown&#39;s time on the floor, the Lakers outscored the Nuggets by 13.</li> 	<li>Linas Kleiza (let&#39;s call him &quot;the Lithuanianugget&quot;) is a good basketball player. When Denver was lacking focus and fight, he hit a big 3, a big 2, had a beautiful dish to Nene (who blew the finish) and dove head first onto the floor, almost nabbing a big turnover.

Cavs coach Mike Brown was keeping the faith Wednesday afternoon as his players completed a light workout at the team&#39;s practice center in Independence. &#39;I still have confidence and trust in this team. This team is together,&#39; Brown said. &#39;They&#39;re determined. I can&#39;t knock the effort I&#39;ve gotten in the four playoff games against those guys. Orlando has shot the (heck) out of the ball and hit two big shots at the end of games. &#39;You don&#39;t ever expect to be down 1-3. You know it can happen. That&#39;s part of life. We&#39;re looking forward to Game 5,&#39; Brown added.&quot;</li> 	<li><a href=""http://www.palmbeachpost.com/heat/content/sports/epaper/2009/05/27/0527alston.html"" target=""new"">Chris Perkins of the Palm Beach Post:</a> &quot;Rafer Alston, an amicable 6-footer with a New York accent, has a past dotted with arrests, questions about his character and doubts about his basketball skills. And that one-game suspension he served in the conference semifinals against Boston for smacking guard Rajon Rondo on the back of the head didn&#39;t help matters. When you consider that backdrop, it&#39;s somewhat amazing that Alston will start for the Magic at 8:30 p.m. Thursday in Game 5 of the Eastern Conference finals in Cleveland. In fact, Alston&#39;s ability to outplay Cavaliers guard Mo Williams is a big reason the Magic is on the verge of upsetting the team with the NBA&#39;s best regular-season record.&quot;</li> 	<li><a href=""http://newsok.com/will-birdman-fly-south-to-okc/article/3373055?custom_click=pod_headline_nba-thunder"" target=""new"">Berry Tramel of The Oklahoman:</a> &quot;The Birdman will be a free agent as soon as his Denver Nuggets finish, in victory or defeat, their NBA playoff push. Should the Thunder make a play for Chris Andersen? The Birdman is just what the Thunder needs, an interior defensive presence. Despite making just one start and averaging just 20.6 minutes per game, the Birdman placed second in the league in blocked shots, his 2.5 per game trailing only Dwight Howard\'s 2.9. Andersen is the new Dennis Rodman. The young Dennis Rodman. Rodman eventually became a kook and more trouble than he was worth, but the early Rodman was a wonderful, unique player. ... Would Thunder general manager Sam Presti take a flier on Birdman? No. Presti would sign Andersen only after the most intense research into the Birdman\'s rehabilitation. My guess is, Birdman is not worth the financial risk. Maintaining fiscal sanity, so that the upcoming big contracts for Kevin Durant and Co. can be offered.&quot;</li> 	<li><a href=""http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/spt/stories/052808dnspomavslede.3a9a97b.html"" target=""new"">Eddie Sefko of The Dallas Morning News:</a> &quot;A lot of point guards are on the Mavericks&#39; list,just as there were a lot of them brought in last week for workouts. That doesn&#39;t mean any of them will be on their roster in September, when training camp opens. One point guard that already has been linked to them through various reports is Spain&#39;s Ricky Rubio. He is expected to be either the second or third player taken in the draft, after Oklahoma&#39;s Blake Griffin. To get the 6-4 Rubio, the Mavericks would have to persuade Memphis (No. 2) or Oklahoma City (No. 3) to take part in a trade. &#39;He&#39;s the most highly anticipated point guard to come out of Europe &ndash; ever,&#39; Donnie Nelson said. &#39;Tony Parker didn&#39;t have quite the same resume until he hit the ground over here.&#39; Part of the reason why the 18-year-old Rubio has been linked to the Mavericks is because he is often called a young Jason Kidd. It would be intriguing to have him work with the 36-year-old Kidd for a season or two before taking over for him. There is no evidence that the Mavericks are in any serious discussions with the teams near the top of the draft order. But starting today, at the Chicago camp, all the personnel executives will be gathered at one place, meaning plenty of talks will take place.&quot;</li> 	<li><a href=""http://www.torontosun.com/sports/basketball/2009/05/28/9595111-sun.html"" target=""new"">Mike Ganter of the Toronto Sun:</a> &quot;Jim Kelly, the Raptors senior director of player personnel is in the midst of scheduling, rescheduling, and re-rescheduling his next few weeks as he tries to ensure the Raptors get an up-close-and personal look at as many players of interest as possible. The problem is that quite often his efforts seem to conflict with those of the agents and the players they represent. &#39;It&#39;s a real challenge just to get guys to come up,&#39; Kelly said from the NBA draft combine in Chicago, where he and the Raptors braintrust, seven in all, including president and GM Bryan Colangelo, have assembled to get another look at some of their options in the draft. It widely has been speculated that Pittsburgh power forward DeJuan Blair will be among those attending Toronto&#39;s next private workout next Thursday at the Air Canada Centre, but Kelly can&#39;t say that for sure. It&#39;s still a week away and things could, and very well may, change by then. &#39;At this point I can&#39;t say for sure that we have everyone we want to see in a workout assigned to a date,&#39; Kelly admitted. &#39;It&#39;s a moving target.&#39; Kelly is dealing with various agendas in trying to get this worked out. First there is the agent, who Kelly readily concedes is just looking out for his client, but who wants to control the workout process and perhaps influence the draft in that way. &#39;Agents are in control of less and less these days,&#39; Kelly said. &#39;They can&#39;t control salaries (of players entering the NBA via the draft because those are slotted by the league).

Brown was likely hoping that either Howard would miss some shots or the Magic would not feature him early. He was wrong on both counts, as Howard scored 11 points in the game&#39;s first six minutes. In Game 3 the Cavs left Rafer Alston alone in the first quarter as they were trying to deal with both Howard and the perimeter threats (more on this later). Forced to choose his poison, it&#39;s likely that Brown will again make Alston get Orlando off to a good start. Once Howard proved that he needed extra attention, the Magic started bombing away to counter the double-teams Howard drew. It took them more than seven minutes to finally make a shot (any shot), but when they did, they hit 3-of-4 on 3-pointers in less than a minute. Still, Brown&#39;s strategy of mixing up when and where the doubles come from is the best option for him. The hope is to coax Howard into a turnover by surprising him with the double.&quot;</li> 	<li>Peter Mickeal, who had a cup of coffee in the NBA, has been playing in Europe and<a href=""http://weblogs.newsday.com/sports/basketball/knicks/blog/2009/05/rubio_is_amazing.html"" target=""_blank""> raves about Ricky Rubio</a>.</li> 	<li>Every website wrestles with rowdy commenters. <a href=""http://www.blazersedge.com/2009/5/27/891094/a-new-day-at-blazersedge"" target=""_blank"">Dave from BlazersEdge lays down the law</a>: &quot;If you call someone a moron or uninformed you will be banned.

They were getting chuckles over what seemed to be some serious over-coaching by players&#39; agents. Many agents hire media coaches to help players prepare for interviews. A few executives noted that players represented by the same agent were giving identical answers to questions. My favorite? &#39;What are your hobbies?&#39; Their answer? &#39;My hobby is doing community service. That&#39;s what I like to do in my spare time.&#39;&quot; Media coaching, to me, is not at all giving people lines to memorize. Can&#39;t just about everyone see through that? <em>Oh really, you&#39;ve been passionate about community service your whole life? I notice very few teenagers are like that, and you haven&#39;t done much of it.</em> Real media coaching is getting people to be relaxed, engaging and at their smartest even in the high-pressure situations. Trying to recite lines is like the opposite of that.</li> 	<li>A lot of Orlando&#39;s success comes down to having made a lot of 3-pointers that they might normally miss. That&#39;s a fact. The Magic have made shots! But the deal is, you have to play well enough in every other facet of the game that some extra made shots will get you the win. Many a bad team loses games even with some hot shooters on the floor. Great defense all night long makes it so a few extra made shots (Rashard Lewis&#39; crazy catch, turn and shoot a 3 anyone?) will be enough to push you over the top.</li> 	<li>When they&#39;re in Milwaukee, most NBA teams stay at the Pfister Hotel. <a href=""http://www.wisn.com/cnn-news/19586075/detail.html"" target=""_blank"">Which may or may not be haunted</a>.</li> 	<li><a href=""http://www.nba.com/suns/news/scoutingthedraft_090527.html"" target=""_blank"">Suns executive David Griffin, in a bigger Suns.com interview</a> about the trend of teams running group draft workouts together, had this to say about the 2009 draft generally: &quot;It&#39;s probably not a pretty top-heavy group. I don&#39;t know that there&#39;s a traditional franchise building block there at the top of the draft. But we think it&#39;s very deep.  We have two second round picks at No. 48 and No. 57 and I think those are picks that we&#39;re really optimistic that we&#39;ll get real value with this year. There were 25 kids who didn&#39;t attend Portsmouth this year that were invited. The vast majority of those kids made a terrible decision not to play because I can come up with 83 kids right now that we think are draftable.  And given that you can&#39;t play five-on-five anymore in Chicago (pre-Draft camp), a lot of those kids that passed on Portsmouth are going to realize that they should have taken the opportunity to play. There will at least be one or two of those kids that go undrafted because they thought they were too good for Portsmouth. If we can be consistent with our process as a league, people will get hip to the fact that if they really want to participate in this draft they need to be available to work out.&quot;</li> 	<li><a href=""http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/DwightJaynes/~3/rSyvOYt5SNM/the-magic-my-new-favorite-team-to-watch"" target=""_blank"">The model for Greg Oden</a>: Dwight Howard.</li> </ul>",20,0.0,,"Chauncey Billups Dwight Howard Kevin Garnett ",0

The way finances are, that&#39;s one of the big things on a charter, you have to do things that will help your team. Tiger fans get to go on the charters [if they pay].&quot;</p> </blockquote> <p> In basketball circles, while Derrick was at Memphis, Reggie was a mystery. He split time between Memphis and Chicago. He jetted around. But he didn&#39;t have any obvious means of support.</p> <p><a href=""http://www.commercialappeal.com/news/2007/nov/04/brothers-keeper/"" target=""_blank"">Dan Wolken of the Memphis Commercial Appeal asked Reggie Rose about it</a> at the time. This is how he responded:</p> <blockquote> <p>&quot;I&#39;ve got an AAU foundation out of Chicago through Nike, and I&#39;m a director, and I work with inner-city youth in Chicago,&quot; he said. &quot;I&#39;m employed by Nike through AAU basketball. Then I&#39;ve got a nonprofit organization that helps out kids from the Englewood community.&quot;</p> </blockquote> <p>Wait, did Reggie Rose misunderstand that question? He was asked how he makes money, not how he gives it away. Aren&#39;t non-profits for giving goods and services away?</p> <p>I know some people who work in the non-profit world. Money is tight all around! It&#39;s something people tend to do as a sinkhole of money -- not as a source. Reggie Rose tells us he&#39;s integral to not one, but two, non-profits.</p> <p>This is a fascinating answer, in this day and age. I have mentioned more than once on TrueHoop that basketball sources are buzzing about the increased use of non-profits as ways to solve the age-old problem of needing to funnel money to recruits&nbsp;who are supposed to be amateurs. That was a factor in the O.J. Mayo case, and word is non-profits are popping up more regularly <a href=""/blogs/truehoop/0-38-349/Allonzo-Trier-is-in-the-Game--and-So-is-Brandon-Roy-s-Foundation.html"" target=""_blank"">around young prospects</a>.</p> <p>(And let me add here, that I don&#39;t much care about someone like Derrick, or even Reggie, Rose making some money. In my perfect world, elite players like Rose would realize the value of their work in above-board fashion -- instead of navigating the underworld of amateur basketball. What concerns me are the people paying. Who are they? What do they want? Why are they so unwilling to let players act freely? When cash is king in steering players to this or that college, agent, sponsor or something else, then we as fans are investing our energy and passion into an endeavor that is not what it purports to be. I&#39;m in the business of understanding what it really is.)</p> <p>You hate to second-guess somebody&#39;s community work, though. So I tried like crazy to find records of Reggie Rose&#39;s non-profit. Non-profits are required to file various papers, which are searchable online. Searching every way I know how, I could not find any Chicago-area non-profit with Reggie Rose&#39;s name on it. (I also talked to Wolken, who tells me he did the same thing, with the same result.) I found <a href=""http://www2.guidestar.org/ReportNonProfit.aspx?ein=36-4443411&amp;Mode=NonGx&amp;lid=100727834&amp;dl=False"" target=""_blank"">various things</a> with names and missions that theoretically could have been his foundation. But not with Reggie Rose&#39;s name.</p> <p>And here&#39;s another weird thing: If you&#39;re running a non-profit, and you&#39;re close to super-famous Derrick Rose, then you have one thing going for you: The media is all over Derrick Rose, and the media can help you spread the word and raise money. And it&#39;s a good cause! You&#39;re helping kids! This foundation could even boosts Derrick&#39;s profile in the eyes of NBA teams and potential corporate sponsors. Wouldn&#39;t you be singing the story of the non-profit into every microphone that strayed near you? Where are the photos from this non-profits events?</p> <p>I also searched for times Reggie Rose mentioned his non-profit to the media. The only one I could find was in response to Wolken&#39;s question about how Rose supported himself.&nbsp;</p> <p>Help me out here. Help Reggie Rose out. Fill in the gaps.

Shooters, cutting, passing, layups, dunks ... this is what this team has learned to do! At its worst, on the other hand, ten players are standing still. This patented Cleveland bog down, most of the time, is a victory in and of itself for Orlando. LeBron James, catching the ball on the move, is probably the most efficient scoring machine in the NBA.

But viewed as the motivation to continuously lack creativity in deploying the best player in the game ... it can seem hard-headed beyond sense.</p> <p>But not tonight.</p> <p>The true &quot;everybody watch LeBron&quot; offense began just inside the six-minute mark. James caught the ball at the free throw line, while all of his teammates stood waiting in the wings. After making his move he missed, and fell down. It was a two-point game.</p> <p>Cleveland then ran the same play four out of five times.</p> <p>The first time James scored over Rafer Alston. The second time, James dished to Daniel Gibson for a 3.</p> <p>The third possession in the sequence -- a real play with cutting and everything -- was clearly a mistake, as it resulted in a Mo Williams missed 3.</p> <p>For the fourth, James dribbled out most of the clock, catching his breath, and then faded for two points. The fifth, he dished to a cutting Anderson Varejao, who missed the dunk, but James got the board, and Cleveland set up the same play again. James scored while fouling out Orlando&#39;s leader, Dwight Howard. James also hit the &quot;and one&quot; free throw.&nbsp;</p> <p>By that time, thanks to this play -- which had delivered ten points on four possessions -- the Cavaliers were up eight with 2:21 to play, and it felt like the game was decided for the home team.</p> <p>For good measure, the Cavaliers ran the same play twice more, resulting in a James step-back two, and another dish to Varejao, who this time completed a three-point play.&nbsp;</p> <p>Final tally: Six momentous possessions.

Still, with Cleveland trailing the Magic, 3-1, in these Eastern Conference finals, Williams&#39; belief in his team did not waver. In himself? That surely faltered, he admitted Thursday. Williams has been taking extra shooting practice this series, arriving at the gym early on the mornings of games to work on his accuracy. He has not been pressing, he said. He &#39;just wanted to perform well so bad.&#39; The practice paid off in the Cavaliers&#39; 112-102 Game 5 victory as Williams knocked in 24 points on 7-of-14 shooting -- with six baskets from 3-point range.

Southern California swingman DeMar DeRozan said he doesn&#39;t pay attention to draft speculation, but people have told him that some analysts compare him to NBA star Vince Carter. DeRozan&#39;s beef? &#39;I think I can jump higher than Vince Carter did,&#39; DeRozan told reporters at a Chicago hotel. After running drills trying to impress scouts at the league&#39;s draft combine with their athletic gifts and basketball intelligence, the top prospects for June&#39;s draft then went about making their cases to the media.

It was a light workout. &#39;It&#39;s nerve-wracking, seeing all those GMs, the guys evaluating. You just have to relax.&#39; Teague has not hired an agent and has until June 15 to decide whether to stay in the draft or return to Wake Forest for his junior season. He is widely projected to go in the lower portion of the first round of the June 25 draft, which means at least a guaranteed two-year contract. One aspect that plays in Teague&#39;s favor is that even though he&#39;s 6-1, he has a 6-7 wingspan, meaning he can defend taller players.&quot;</li> 	<li><a href=""http://www.sacbee.com/sports/story/1900683.html"" target=""new"">Sam Amick of the Sacramento Bee:</a> &quot;Chase Budinger had already learned the art of &#39;no comment.&#39; At least when it came to addressing the media.

Just like other players who would be asked the most personal of questions during this portion of the predraft combine, Budinger had to say something. Even if he was speechless. &#39;One team asked me if I had a girlfriend, and I said no,&#39; Budinger said as he relayed the story of one interview to the media. &#39;And then they asked me if I had any friends with benefits.

North Carolina&#39;s Danny Green also said he&#39;s scheduled for Charotte that day. The key audition in that group could well be Henderson, since the Bobcats are very much in the market for a shooting guard at No. 12. Henderson met with Bobcats coach Larry Brown and general manager Rod Higgins in Chicago, and they expressed to him that a backup to Raja Bell is a priority. &#39;They made it clear they need someone,&#39;&#39; Henderson said, referring to Bell&#39;s late-season injury problems. Henderson grew up in Philadelphia and has known Brown since he was in middle-school and Brown was the 76ers coach. One of Henderson&#39;s close friends in high school is the son of Randy Ayers, who worked for Brown in Philadelphia. &#39;That would be a great place for me,&#39; Henderson said of the Bobcats.&quot;</li> 	<li><a href=""http://blogs.twincities.com/timberwolves/2009/05/kahn-feels-right-at-home-at-dr.html"" target=""new"">Don Seeholzer of The Pioneer Press:</a> &quot;David Kahn, who was hired last Friday, said he received a warm welcome from league officials today when he attended a competition committee hearing and that there was a surprisingly large number of familiar faces. &#39;Much has changed, but a lot of teams are still the same,&#39; Kahn said. &#39;It&#39;s very comfortable and it&#39;s not like I&#39;ve been completely out of the loop for the last few years with my involvement in the D-league. So it&#39;s not strictly an old home week for me.&#39; Regarding the decision on coach Kevin McHale&#39;s future, Kahn said they had a good meeting Tuesday night and will meet again next week but otherwise declined to comment. With three first-round picks, the Wolves figure to be involved in plenty of trade talks before the June 25 draft, but Kahn said there was none of that today. &#39;I think a lot of my colleagues pulled back,&#39; he said. &#39;They realize this is Day 7 for me.

As I&#39;m in workouts, I&#39;m going to do the same. I feel like I can play with anybody in the country whether it&#39;s ACC competition, Big Ten, Big 12, it don&#39;t matter. I feel like I can play with them.&#39; That swagger comes from a four-year career where he became known for making big shots -- including the winner in the first round of the NCAA tournament against Duke his sophomore season. Pistons president of basketball operations Joe Dumars said after the team&#39;s first-round playoff exit that promising second-year player Rodney Stuckey would be more effective as a combo guard and not a pure point guard where he is the primary ball-handler at all times. The draft is loaded with point guards so if the Pistons want to go that route with the 15th pick of the first round of the June 25 NBA draft, Maynor, projected to go in the middle of the opening round, would appear to be a candidate.&quot;</li> 	<li><a href=""http://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/basketball/bulls/chi-29-bulls-bitsmay29,0,7059838.story"" target=""new"">K.C.

According to NCAA allegations first reported by the Memphis Commercial-Appeal and Chicago high school sources informing the Sun-Times, some person other than Rose allegedly took his college-entrance SAT, and someone with access to Rose&#39;s Simeon transcripts changed one of his grades from a D to a C just as Rose was applying to colleges. So what, you say. He&#39;s a pro now. He was always gonna be a baller. Go, Bulls! That&#39;s fine. Live in your world of beer-can-on-the-belly sports relativism. But just ponder the ripple effect and the hypocrisy revealed by the academic fraud before you lumber to the fridge for another cold one. First off, Rose might never have gotten into a powerhouse hoops college like Memphis without the cheating. He might have had to spend time at a junior college or even go overseas to play.
